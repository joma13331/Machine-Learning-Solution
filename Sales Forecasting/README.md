This project is based on the Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/overview.
Here based on five years of sales data for 50 items in 10 stores we are asked to predict sales for next 90 days for each item in each of the stores. 
The model which makes the prediction is created using deeplearning.
