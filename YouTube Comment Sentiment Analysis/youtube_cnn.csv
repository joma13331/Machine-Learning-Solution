But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6

Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures.1CORINTHIANS 15:3-8

The Bible says that we are all sinners.
As it is written: There is none righteous no not one. Romans 3:10
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23
But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6
For the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23(the word “death” in this verse means eternal separation, from God in hell).
Come now,  and let us reason together,  saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.Isaiah 1:18
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures.1CORINTHIANS 15:3-8
In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1:14
For by grace ye are saved, through faith; and not of yourselves     
it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vein. Galatians 2:21
If you would like to receive Jesus as your Savior. Realize that you are a hopeless sinner and trust in Jesus and only Jesus to save you.
You can say a prayer expression your gratitude, sorrow for sins etc. but remember your prayer doesn’t save you.
Your trust in Jesus and what He did for you on the cross, is what saves you.
The moment you trust in Jesus and only Jesus, you are saved.
After people get saved they get baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

409,How the Olympics are Drawing Attention to China’s Intimidation,2022-02-04,"I have been asking following questions for more than 6 months but can’t receive any answers. See if you can help (1) Why even China’s president could only have one child due to the strictly enforced one child per family policy from 1979 to 2016 but all the “persecuted” Uyghurs and Tibetans were not subject to this policy and allowed to have multiple kids? Have you seen such “Genocide”? You don’t want to ask why our medias and politicians never told you this so obvious fact that every Chinese knows? Why all minorities including Uyghurs can get vast benefits such as extra free points added to their college admission exam scores to give the minorities better chance to be admitted to colleges, reserved positions in the government, etc.? All these policies are clearly written in their law and every single Chinese knows.  (2) Many Uyghur fighters were captured in Afghanistan and detained in Guantanamo and ETIM was also listed as a terrorist organization by the US government. So, Uyghurs used to be persecuted by the US as well? Why suddenly ETIM was delisted as a terrorist organization?  Simply because ETIM is our enemy’s enemy?  (3) Any mass persecutions are always combined with refugee crisis much less a genocide which is the uttermost form of persecution. In addition to genocide, our allegations also include incarceration of more than 1 million or about 8% of the entire Uyghur population in concentration camps and forced labor. If our accusations are true, we must have seen a notable refugee crisis like those we have seen in many other regions. Just think about when almost 10 million “repressed” Uyghurs desperately escape from China and how many troops Chinese government needs to deploy! But why our satellites which can read a license plate clearly can’t show us a single image of such humanitarian crisis such as the refugee camps along the border or Uyghurs flocking to the border but blocked by Chinese troops? Why are we only given so called satellite photo evidence of “concentration camps”? How do you know that these buildings are concentration camps? Simply because they are enclosed with a wall? In China, I saw all the schools from elementary to college, hospitals, factories, etc. are enclosed with a wall. Why in one such “evidence”, you can even find a big garden in a “concentration camp”?  Why BBC needs to blur the date on the passport of a “concentration camp victim” simply because the printed date indicates that her passport was issued and renewed while she was “detained” in the “concentration camp”? (4) If Uyghurs are forced labors why China has been trying its best to make cotton production so highly mechanized which can be easily proved by the American company John Deere’s own sales report? (5) Why when China invited independent international investigation, a lot of countries including many Muslim countries accepted except the western nations who claimed to investigate by themselves but if someone files a lawsuit against you, as the defendant, can you accept any investigations conducted by the plaintiff?  Can you accept a judge who already believes the narratives of the plaintiff and vows to punish you? (6) Why no Muslim countries join this game of disinformation against China? (7) Why after investigating in Xinjiang, Fariz Mehdawi, Palestine’s ambassador to China wrote “You know, the number of mosques, if you have to calculate it all, it’s something like 2,000 inhabitants for one mosque. This ratio we don’t have it in our country. It’s not available anywhere. Are we diplomates so naïve that we could be maneuvered to believe anything or are we part of a conspiracy that we would justify something against what we had seen? I think this is not respectful. There is no conspiracy here, there is facts. And the fact of the matter is that China is rising and developing everywhere, including Xinjing. Since some people are not happy about that, they would like to stop the rise of China by any means.” (8) Why I have been asking above questions for so many months but none of the Uyghur issue activists dare to really answer my questions? (9) Why the following videos tell me a totally different story? (1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZesLwHGikE  (2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLWD0EfPYaY (3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH-0l_zToN4&t=126s (4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXNBNI6q13k (9) Is it possible that China’s only fault is that it has been advancing too much which makes us so jealous that we can’t help concocting so many fake stories about China?",negative

485,How the Olympics are Drawing Attention to China’s Intimidation,2022-02-03,"I’m also concerned about Beijing but my question is this, what can we do about it? As part of the American workers, what can we do about chinas violations from climate and freedom of information, to apartheid of ethnic minorities?  You’ll pardon my French but this is where the ruling class in America is losing us, who decided that all of these violations were ok by the end of the 80’s as long as our economies could do business with theirs, so now not even 30 years later, you want the American people to do what? We are more dependent on them at this point than they are dependent on our good grace. 

This goes back to economic interest, they were more than wiling to turn a blind eye to the human right crisis in China as long as they could build factories there to also exploit laborers, so Americans laborers got screwed and Chinese laborers got screwed, this sounds like that bloody economy our government allowed to happen because the people with money for their campaigns wanted. You made us dependent on this, this was your decision to outsource work to that particular terrible market, I’m sure there were plenty of countries that would have been more than happy to accommodate some of the industry that produces the crap we buy in America, with any amount of human rights accommodations that our government demanded as a condition to doing business with us. 

the mainstream media for its part never did anything to educate their audience in America, we’ve been living in this bubble for decades with way below the average knowledge of the world out there, why? Because the ruling class did all they could to not have class consciousnesses in America. 

now they have been bombarding American workers (I was going to mention the middle class but we have none left) about how evil the Chinese are being to their people? No they are complaining about how the Chinese government is being towards American big businesses! That’s what’s important in this current PR campaign, it’s not the American consumers, definitely not the American workers, and above all it’s not about the Muslims in China. 

it’s about American big corporations, that’s all, at least be open about it, you’re propaganda has fallen so low that you’re making that Soviet style propaganda look good.

The Russian military that got beat by tiny Chechnya in 1994-96.  
The Russian military under Putin that took 10 years to tame Chechnya in the second war.
The Russian military that performed pathetically during the brief Georgia invasion.
The Russian military that has 50% one year conscripts that are not trained because Russia lacks an NCO corp.
Four times Russia had revolutions in response to unpopular wars.
If Russia invaded Ukarine, that would provide Chechnya to make another breakaway attempt to add to their 16 others going back to the late 1600's. 
Russia would then have to fight a two front war.
Russia and PUtin have some serious limitations.  After the Georgia debacle, Putin made reforms but is limited by Russia's limited funding. Much of the ""professional volunteer"" force are really two year conscripts who sign on for an extra year to get better pay and living conditions.  
I think people with brains are realizing the serious limitations Putin faces.
I think it is possible that in addition to trying to leverage the west into no longer expanding, Putin is showcasing his military in a ""scary"" way to be taken seriously when more and more intelligent people are realizing the fundamental flaws and weaknesses and limitations of the Russian military.

I have mentioned this before but my best moments with my father was having him help me learn how to polish my bronze and copper badge...sooo cool.

Policing is just so much human to human community impact. There is not one minute that can be wasted as a police officer when it comes to their RESCUING WORK. They are always rescuing humans from the worst of life's challenges. There is not a higher calling. There is not any job that requires more self control, study, daily learning, and problem solving. Doctors and lawyers too...soldiers, nurses, plumbers, carpenters...every job is...or should be a calling of sorts.

The greatest challenge police officers have is the overuse of authoritarianism both in their words and deeds. It will always be hard to be democratic with regard to criminal behavior. Response to any danger requires that someone have the training and ability to rescue and respond appropriately. When Adrenalin is seeping through your circulatory system, your perception of the level of threat, is your challenge. Hopefully, your training gives you the proper tools to self police as well as public safety policing. It will always hurt to watch humans fall short of their own humanity towards one another. All the violence that endangers everyone will always provide you with ""job security"" and work.

But then trying to destroy our democratic republic in the sycophantic service of a would be dictator should cost him everything he’s got - and his freedom too.

I myself experienced discrimination against me a number of times as I was in a college in Chicago just because I'm a Japanese.

Even as I took my mother and sister to Switzerland, there was a restaurant that sent us all the way back where we could not even see the spectacular mountain and lake views from our table, and our table was way so distant from where European tourists were sitting. There were some unused tables though. I wanted to show my mother and sister beautiful terrace views during our lunch, which I had booked with this restaurant well in advance, but I was so shocked and sad, and felt so bad for my mother and sister. And yet, my mother was still gently smiling. For that, I tried and tried to fight back my tears with all my might while I ate. Believe it or not, this was a Michelin five star restaurant.

In Tokyo or Kyoto before COVID, there were so many Americans, Canadians, Brits, and Europeans visiting there or living there, but Japanese never treat them differently or we even treat them better with hospitality.

2395,Asian American Hate: Reflections and the Road Ahead,2022-02-03,"The goal should be to reject hate as opposed to stopping hate which is impossible.  You can't change other people.  Rejecting hate means not internalizing the hate as a reflection of you.  Recognizing that people who lash out at certain people for what they look like are not going to change just for you.  Violence against Asians is nothing new at all.  Amara Walker can clutch her pearls but that is not going to arm our children with tools to deal with racial hatred.  The racial hatred is no different from what the black community has suffered for centuries.  AAPI people are not going to ""blend"" and there will always be othering of AAPI people.  The sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can change this situation of anti-Asian hatred is to shine high beams on the situation and speaking out LOUD.  That is why AAPI people keep getting targeted, because the attackers believe we won't fight back.  We shouldn't just ""take it,"" you call it out and let the perp know it.  Just like any other bully, the blow back needs to be twice as hard without sympathy.  As Olivia Munn and Lisa Ling said, you have to speak out.  You have to get involved when a racist incident occurs because it will eventually come back to impact you.  I hope Kyung Lah understands by now that we are not white adjacent.   I appreciate her kind spirit but it is naive to believe that just because you are kind, others should be kind to you.  The world doesn't work that way and raising our kids to believe that leaves them vulnerable.  Racism does a really harsh number on a child's self esteem and psyche.  What kids really need is for an adult to assure them who they are, they are perfect just the way they are and that the parent will do everything to keep them safe.  If the parent says I don't know why racists are doing this does not help them one iota.  Make each incident a teachable moment, e.g. let the child know that the racist(s) is a person you never want to be.  Also, ever take a look at these racists?  They are exactly what Darwinism would operate to mitigate propogation of the species.  99 out of 100 times, the racists have been the most unfortunate looking,  low hanging fruit.  Let the child know these racists are suffering from severe delusion because of their inadequecies - they're all around losers.  And you don't want the child to grow into a loser like that.",negative

2546,Asian American Hate: Reflections and the Road Ahead,2022-02-03,"Not the greatest start to this conversation, citing the Atlanta spa shootings as an anti-asian hate crime. According to investigators and the shooter, he was motivated by sexual and religious confusion/conflict revolving around his supposed sex addiction. He had frequented those spas and considered them sources of sexual temptation. So he targeted them for that reason. That's what all the evidence indicated. And there was no evidence or testimony to the contrary. 

Of course he's a monster for doing what he did, but there's no indication that he was motivated by anti-asian animus. But that incident was jammed into the anti-asian hate crime narrative by some for reasons I can't understand. 

That seemed to set the tone for the rest of the conversation as well. Lots of discussion about the issue in the abstract and about problems on the margins coupled with an avoidance of the elephants in the room. Am I breaking news here if I bring up that asians are being discriminated against in college admissions and attacked regularly in big cities? Is it problematic if I bring up that that blacks and asians have been at odds with each other in big cities for decades? Weirdly, these issues are glossed over in this discussion. Did they even mention the college admissions issue? If they did, it was so quick that I missed it.

The Bible says that we are all sinners.
As it is written: There is none righteous no not one. Romans 3:10
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23
But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6
For the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23(the word “death” in this verse means eternal separation, from God in hell).
Come now,  and let us reason together,  saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.Isaiah 1:18
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures.1CORINTHIANS 15:3-8
In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1:14
For by grace ye are saved, through faith; and not of yourselves     
it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vein. Galatians 2:21
If you would like to receive Jesus as your Savior. Realize that you are a hopeless sinner and trust in Jesus and only Jesus to save you.
You can say a prayer expression your gratitude, sorrow for sins etc. but remember your prayer doesn’t save you.
Your trust in Jesus and what He did for you on the cross, is what saves you.
The moment you trust in Jesus and only Jesus, you are saved.
After people get saved they get baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
It is for believers only and has nothing to do with your salvation.",positive

Along with CNN's chorus of interesting news presenters and contributors, a pleasant voice is what makes our ears turn our heads and tune in to what you folks are talking about over there in the land of the free and home of the brave. What's hard to see is that in present-day America, honest citizens have to put up with armed marauders taking over their cars. This shows that inequality has not been improved by stimulus checks. But we know Uncle Joe is working on it.

Trump. Senator Lindsey Graham's lethal submarine stealth missile attack against the Trump ship-of-lies is surely the first sign that former President Trump has lost any hope of having the chain-gang of support he has had from Graham and some of Trump's top-ranking Republican allies. Graham's glaring declaration of war is not only a sign that he has come out of his Trump-induced coma, but it has blasted a Titanic-sized, gaping hole in the former presidents possible attempt to sail into your nation's 2024 presidential election with any hope of re-election. This time Trump has drawn a line in the sand that no sane politician would ever cross over, because it shows a reckless pseudo-politician's feeble attempt to get himself off the hook.That Senator Graham has finally seen the light is good news for America and for the free world and if the fates decide, perhaps Trump will also acknowledge that his presence on the national and international stage is doing no one including himself any good.",positive

3826,Gov. Ron DeSantis lashes out when asked about anti-Semitic incidents,2022-02-02,"30 seconds into this and I'm thinking, ""How come law enforcement aren't mowing these people down."" It's uncharitable wish-fulfillment, but just: if violent people are demonstrating to incite more, antithetical to our principles and our laws, how is the freedom of speech an excuse to allow them the freedom to wreck everything we stand for?

Makes us look like this is what we are, that these are the principles we believe in as Christians, as conservatives, as Americans. Has any behavior looked so anti-Christian? These folk are acting like antichrists.

That's one argument. But how 'bout this one: Is this a white thing? Does law enforcement only apply to protests made up of black and Hispanic people? Muslims? Floors me the police aren't protecting and serving citizens equally, aren't protecting and serving the most vulnerable. Seems the motto has become ""If it's white, it's right;""-- Mm, funny pun there underneath all that-- ""if it's brown, it's down."" 

Can't we just kinda use ropes to sort of herd them into horse trailers or something? (Get the ironic symbolism running all throughout that one?)

No, violence is just what they want to justify more. Yet the absence of law enforcement for something like this is rather revealing, seems to be sanctioning the views by their doing nothing, doing it wrong yet again.

Wonder why law enforcement's first duty isn't to take the side of protesters, to protect their safety and only that, to take a black/white approach to this.

That's a better argument. But here's another: If we're really about antisemitism, pluralism, antidiscrimination, human rights and civil liberties, where's the contradiction in violence prevention? Where's the contradiction in hating hate, in prosecuting it for knowing where it leads?

The simplest solution is the violent fantasy of automated machine guns popping out the ground at the clan rally held in the woods. The best solution is to deter such demonstrations of hate, to address the root causes of these tendencies: religion, isolation, insecurity, moral poverty, insularity and the lack of good jobs with pensions.

Gone on too long in my ruminations. Apologies. Last thing tying all this up in a bow: Was thinking earlier today about the high cost of rents when visiting my uncle's new place (previous landlord was selling), that across the country, this means income has to also increase to maintain the rule of thumb that rent should never be more than a week's pay for upward mobility. Yet our philosophy is to keep wages low that businesses can prosper, and the two forces are ensuring we create a nation unable to pay their bills, let alone save up enough to own anything of their own. How's that remotely meeting our obligations to be responsible if we keep undercutting the means to do it?

Think this is driving most of the resentment and anger seen in these protests. Think it's been driving it for a decade and a half now.

Most people don’t even know that there are people who are Jewish in faith (who may not be racially or ethnically Jewish) and Jewish in race and ethnicity.

I think we all need to look at the facts with our U.S. society, and how we want to respect what EVERYONE wants to identify as, when really it's hard to be politically correct when identifying everyone. The 'new age' jews I've met lately, don't like other jews, or the Jewish way of life, so they consider themselves, apart of the white race. They identify as 'white'.  'New age jews AKA millennials', say their parents are Jewish, or their grandmother is Jewish, but they are not Jewish. It's so confusing because people that are of Jewish descent deny their own Jewish heritage, so if they don't talk about it, you honestly don't know. I can attest,  they will tell you they identify as being apart of the 'white' race. On job applications, surveys and even some U.S. government documents 'Jewish' is not listed as a 'race'; your only options are black, white, Native American, Asian, etc. 'Jewish' is not listed unless religion is in question: Muslim, Christian, Judaism or Jewish non-practicing, Agnostic, etc.. A lot of new age people of Jewish descent will not cancel Whoopi because they have denied their own Jewish heritage. It's confusing for a lot of people because we want to respect what everyone wants to identify as with 'race',  white race, black race, etc. But, when everyone is demanding that you respect what they 'identify' as with race on an official document or what they tell you, it gets confusing. This debate is so confusing with the times. It's like Native American verses Mexican--- there are some Mexicans that get upset, if you do not realize their heritage of being of Native American descent because their Native American ancestors were colonized by the spanish. Then there are Pakistani verses Hindus ---Both groups are of Indian descent but depending on which group you're talking to one may say their Indian and another group may deny their Indian identity, but on a job application, when it comes to 'race', they would identify as 'Asian'. 

I don't believe that Whoopi did anything wrong; it's truly the times we are living in now, you have to really ask people what they want to identify as. Unfortunately, there are groups that 'pass' without delving in to their history and then there are others you can just look at and know which race they are apart of, even if you don't know their heritage or ethnic background.",positive

Counsel culture is exactly what should be taking place.
The idea that one mistake defines, anything/anyone, in totality is, beyond ludicrous.
Ignorance isn't a right, a privilege or even a choice, 100% of the time.
It is 100% human, frailty.
Ignorance, is defeated through education, not, a program of eradication and destruction, of a person.
When relentlessly attacked, the response, further alienates.
If, you think I am in error, (because that is what it it is, error).
Then, discuss it. Convince me through dialog, and, tangible proofs, that I am in error.
Condemnation, will always be on the table. Why resort to it, first?
When, the smartest choice is to develop an ally.
An individual, who will then, enlighten others.
Ostracizing and alienating, does nothing but, bring out the worst, in human character.
Why continue to pursue this?
Ultimately, attempts to harm the lives and livelihoods, of those who think differently, is no different than, harming the lives and livelihoods, of those who think differently.
Anotherwards, you are either harming people, for no other reason than, whether they adhere to your thinking or not. Whatever, those values and beliefs, may entail. Regardless, of virtue or repugnance. Is there no protection for the innocent in these, scenarios?
Or, is it acceptable, that a child should endure, hardship due to the, ignorance"", of a parent or loved one?

3992,ADL CEO explains why Whoopi Goldberg shouldn't be 'canceled',2022-02-03,"There’s so much to unpack here…

Ethnicity and race can be linked, but they are different.  “Race” is a social construct that has to do with grouping people according to certain physical characteristics that are easily determined by visual appearance, especially skin color.  “White”, “Black”, “Yellow”, and “Red” are so called “races”.  

Ethnicity on the other hand is more like a sub grouping of race, and has more to do with national/tribal grouping as determined by cultural differences like language, food, clothing, religion, etc.  

If you strip people naked you can probably tell their “race”, but not necessarily their ethnicity.  See the difference?  

Jewish is an ethnicity (descendants of Abraham & Sarah), and a religion (people that practice Judaism), but not a “race”.  That is why people of different “races” can be Jewish.  When a so called “white” person that is Jewish selects their race on a census form, they select “white” not Jewish.  


Humans have a long bloody history of intolerance towards one another based on both race and/or ethnicity, and while they overlap in many instances, in others they do not.  

Since they really didn’t have any “racial” minority groups in Germany, the German Nazi’s took the ideas of a racial caste system as practiced in America and further applied them to the various European ethnic groups in the“white” race, leaving ethnic European Jews on the bottom of their caste system, and blue eyed blonde haired Ayrians on top (it is worth noting here, that they considered the melanated people of Asian, African and American decent to be lower still).  Then they went about their business of the mass ethnic cleansing and genocide of those other “White” ethnic groups that they considered to be most undesirable.

Now that’s a lot for people to wrap their heads around, so Whoopi tried to bring it all back to the basic idea that people treat other people poorly when they have the power to do so.",positive

4013,ADL CEO explains why Whoopi Goldberg shouldn't be 'canceled',2022-02-03,"The U.S. Holocaust Museum, in what appeared to be a response to Goldberg, added: “Racism was central to Nazi ideology. Jews were not defined by religion, but by race. Nazi racist beliefs fueled genocide and mass murder.”

Among those to rebuke Goldberg was Greenblatt, who characterized her words as a “distortion” of the Nazi genocide.

“No @WhoopiGoldberg, the #Holocaust was about the Nazis’ systematic annihilation of the Jewish people — who they deemed to be an inferior race,” Greenblatt tweeted. “They dehumanized them and used this racist propaganda to justify slaughtering 6 million Jews. Holocaust distortion is dangerous. #ENOUGH.”

Goldberg apologized Monday evening for her comments, quoting Greenblatt’s tweet before adding, “I stand corrected.” The actress and comedian said the Holocaust was indeed about race, adding the Jewish people have her full support.

That same night, Goldberg appeared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” where she backtracked on her comments and clarified what she meant.

“I think of race as being something that I can see,” she said. “So, I see you and I know what race you are.”

The Holocaust “wasn’t based on the skin,” she continued. “You couldn’t tell who was Jewish. They had to delve deeply to figure it out … My point is, they had to do the work.”

Greenblatt appeared on “The View” the following day to discuss the controversy directly with Goldberg and her fellow cohosts.

Hours later, Goldberg was suspended from “The View” for two weeks over her initial comments.

“While Whoopi has apologized, I’ve asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact of her comments,” ABC President Kim Godwin said in a statement. “The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family, and communities.”

During Tuesday’s show, neither Greenblatt nor any of the show’s cohosts noted that the ADL’s own redefinition of racism appears to contradict Greenblatt’s comments on race and the Holocaust while, ironically, supporting Goldberg’s.

Over the weekend, the ADL came under fire for changing how it defines racism. The current definition on ADL’s website reads: “The marginalization and/or oppression of people of color based on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.”

The definition previously stated: “Racism is the belief that a particular race is superior or inferior to another, that a person’s social and moral traits are predetermined by his or her inborn biological characteristics. Racial separatism is the belief, most of the time based on racism, that different races should remain segregated and apart from one another.”

Critics argued the change from a traditional definition to a more controversial one was a sign of the ADL embracing an explicitly left-wing ideology.

According to internet archives, the definition was updated in July 2020, when riots and protests demanding racial justice erupted nationwide in the wake of George Floyd’s death.

The edit went largely unnoticed by the public until this past weekend, when it received media coverage and criticism on social media. Much of the criticism noted that the ADL’s definition defines racism as something that explicitly benefits white people and can only be perpetrated against people of color.

It’s unclear how the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust, most of whose victims were European Jews with white skin, can fit within the ADL’s definition of racism. The definition appears to support Goldberg’s initial claims about the Holocaust, despite them being refuted by historical fact, while undermining Greenblatt’s response.

“This is entirely unacceptable,” the Jewish Policy Center said of the ADL definition.

“The ADL defines ‘racism’ as something that explicitly benefits white people, koshering any kind of race-based hatred — *very much including antisemitism*, it must be said — that doesn’t,” wrote Seth Mandel, executive editor of the Washington Examiner magazine.

It was all about 'race' - picking out a sector of people like that to kill them, just because they are Jewish... is about race.  What about Charlottesville?  Did Whoopi not understand when they were chanting:  Jews will not replace us?  Indicating that Jews are a separate race?

I grew up like Whoopi thinking Judaism was a religion.  This is what the dictionary says.  The guy that was talking to Don Lemon you could not tell that he is a Jew until he said it.  I know when they ask on the census bureau what race you are I don’t see a Jew on the race column.  I can see recognizing a Jew at the synagogue or when they where their attire, but it is confusing if it is not on the race session.  The race that is seen on application is White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, African then they asked the question what color which most people choose White even if they have dark skin.  Someone please show me in writing where Jews are a race.  That is like saying Catholics are a race.  You can’t tell if a person is Catholic unless they tell a person that they are Catholic.  Please send me materials on Jews are a race.  The Jews have a lot of work to do starting with changing the dictionary, the Census Bureau, and all the studies that are saying Jews are a race.

The enemy has misguided you and misled you and you have walked straight into his trap. That is why there is so much misery in the last two years.

Turn to me for I am Meek and humble of Heart. I will heal you and keep you safe.

You have found peace and safety in the things of the world, even medicine. Had you come to me I would have healed your wounds and taken away the scourge.

But you have put your faith in world and science which are shifting like sifting sand daily. No man is able to lead you, yet you rely on mortals. How long? How long? My heart yearns for you. I long for you. Come back to Me. Take my yoke. And I will heal your land. I will heal your wounded hearts. 

Stop drinking of the libation poured out by the enemy of your soul and drink of Me, the well of Living Water. You will live and be satisfied. 

My hour of return is very near. Do not be foolish. But be wise. Listen to My Spirit. He will guide you into all truth. 

Hold on to Mother Church. Don't not abandon Her even when you see things that make you squirm. I am preparing my bride for my coming. I want her spotless and blameless. 

I am in total control. Trust in me. Do not put your trust in man and in science. But only in Me. 

Listen to My Mother. She is the only safe refuge. She will lead you in the coming times which are filled with trials and persecution. Be not afraid, she will cover you with Her mantle. 

As for those who continue to drink of Satan's libation they will be destroyed. Satan is a liar. He is using the world right now to spread his errors and lies. He has already brought division upon the earth. You will experience this everywhere, wherever you go, even in your families and your own soul. 

But I will reign in the end and my Kingdom will have no end. How I long for you My people. Come to me I am Meek and humble of Heart. Stay safe in Me until I have put all my enemies under my feet!

The Bible says that we are all sinners.
As it is written: There is none righteous no not one. Romans 3:10
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23
But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6
For the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23(the word “death” in this verse means eternal separation, from God in hell).
Come now,  and let us reason together,  saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.Isaiah 1:18
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures.1CORINTHIANS 15:3-8
In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1:14
For by grace ye are saved, through faith; and not of yourselves     
it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vein. Galatians 2:21
If you would like to receive Jesus as your Savior. Realize that you are a hopeless sinner and trust in Jesus and only Jesus to save you.
You can say a prayer expression your gratitude, sorrow for sins etc. but remember your prayer doesn’t save you.
Your trust in Jesus and what He did for you on the cross, is what saves you.
The moment you trust in Jesus and only Jesus, you are saved.
After people get saved they get baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

Просто представьте, что мы, к примеру, устроим переворот в Мексике, поставим своих пешек и будем поставлять оружие для обороны от USA.... Ваши действия? Все познаётся в сравнении. Просто идёт борьба за рынки. Рынок Европы для USA важен, поэтому USA считает, что Россия лишняя там.  Во все мировые войны экономика USA поднималась, может опять настал тот момент? Только сейчас не обойдёт стороной ни одну страну",positive

The Bible says that we are all sinners.
As it is written: There is none righteous no not one. Romans 3:10
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23
But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6
For the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23(the word “death” in this verse means eternal separation, from God in hell).
Come now,  and let us reason together,  saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.Isaiah 1:18
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures.1CORINTHIANS 15:3-8
In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1:14
For by grace ye are saved, through faith; and not of yourselves     
it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vein. Galatians 2:21
If you would like to receive Jesus as your Savior. Realize that you are a hopeless sinner and trust in Jesus and only Jesus to save you.
You can say a prayer expression your gratitude, sorrow for sins etc. but remember your prayer doesn’t save you.
Your trust in Jesus and what He did for you on the cross, is what saves you.
The moment you trust in Jesus and only Jesus, you are saved.
After people get saved they get baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
It is for believers only and has nothing to do with your salvation.",positive

The rest of us are entitled only to cruelty, by their whim. This is how the powerful have ever kept the powerless divided and in their place, and enriched themselves in the process."" 

""It is not just that the perpetrators of this cruelty enjoy it; it is that they enjoy it with one another. Their shared laughter at the suffering of others is an adhesive that binds them to one another, and to Trump."" 

""Trump’s only true skill is the con; his only fundamental belief is that the United States is the birthright of straight, white, Christian men, and his only real, authentic pleasure is in cruelty. It is that cruelty, and the delight it brings them, that binds his most ardent supporters to him, in shared scorn for those they hate and fear: immigrants, blackVoters, feminists, and treasonous white men who empathize with any of those who would steal their birthright. Trump’s ability to execute that cruelty through word and deed makes them euphoric. It makes them feel good, it makes them feel proud, it makes them feel happy, it makes them feel united. And as long as he makes them feel that way, they will let him get away with anything, no matter what it costs them."" 

--Adam Serwer, The Atlantic, December  2019 

He's encouraging and promoting gun violence.

Trump and his supporters believe in law and order, right up until the moment when law and order comes for them.
In other words, it's law and order for YOU, but not for THEM. Their actions on January 6 proves this.
