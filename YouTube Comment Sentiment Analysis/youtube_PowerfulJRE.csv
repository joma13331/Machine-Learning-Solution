So afraid of someone with an audience speaking intelligently in a way that they don’t want to believe, or that disagrees with their precious views. They aren’t even willing to consider, or listen to anything other than what they think is correct. They jump right on the bandwagon, to make sure their liberal ideologies aren’t slightly doubted by the majority of the population. All of these people have never even heard a Rogan podcast. It makes them cry and upsets them so bad. It’s been the most comical thing to sit back and watch and enjoy. I’m so glad Spotify isn’t an American company, and that this will continue. We need to support Joe in any way possible, and get on Spotify and stream his podcasts as much as we can.

118,The Chinese App Using Facial Scans on Teenage Gamers,2022-02-04,"You're right bout taking chances. Everything in peoples lives these days is oriented towards not taking chances, towards safety above all else. Safety for not only self but for those around you. It's drilled into you, and in business, you aren't meant to take risks anymore, you're punished extremely if you take financial risks and fail. It used to be, people would take chances in business all the time and write off losses without ostracizing, firing, or down-levelling them to a lower position.

 to provide an example, even hollywood movie producers and the big movie houses used do strange movies and see if they work, in fact in the early days of hollywood that was the modus operandi. now everything is either a sequel, a huge pre-existing franchise, or a remake. they are not taking chances at all in hollywood. only people like christopher nolan even dare, while darren aronofsky tries to be different. everything in the world especially in first half of the 1900s, there were so many new world-changing events and products happening every 5-10 years that people took chances nonstop. 

but there hasn't been any real change in an entire generation - for 20 years. everything has stagnated and turned focus to ""Safety"" and ""repair"" and ""self-love"". but stagnation is death.

We need people like you to bring us the information that mainstream is suppressing.  

Labelling something ‘Misinformation’ and discrediting people and making them feel hated for being brave enough to do the investigative journalism work that allows truth to rise, is the worlds most disgusting crime being played on humanity. 
Real journalists should be ashamed they failed to do the work Joe Rogan has been brave enough to do — and for trying to cancel him ontop of it!   The shame squarely falls on anyone who doesn’t stand up for freedom, choice, consent, and truth.   
Props Joe.  Keep being brave.    Keep doing you!!! Don’t let the haters get you down.  Truth rises. Keep talking!   Keep being bold!  Don’t let them take your soul or push you into line.

It's ridiculous to think that those two doctors would be excluded from public conversation, given their extensive background and experience. They are not fringe doctors by any stretch of the imagination. My first question for your detractors in these two cases would be, ""What misinformation is being distributed by you?""  Tell us SPECIFICALLY what they are saying that is false. The answer is there are no falsities.  They are either opinions or verifiable facts.  There's a reason they don't specify what ""misinformation"" is being distributed.  I also understand your inclination to have opposing views about this subject, but in my humble opinion, you do that already but understand why you're pushing for it. This is not what a free country does.  This should concern EVERYBODY as far as the canceling and destroying of people's lives that disagree with the left.

If Julianna breaks Amanda again the second time I will believe that Julianna is the best in the 135 division right now. Amanda is ferocious, not my favorite fighter but she has been dominant and pretty much inevitable for six years and I think Amanda took out the women that were most important to her and completely underestimated Julianna, probably looked at her like Megan Anderson.

Peña knew exactly how to fight this match and was better prepared mentally and physically.  If Peña maintains her current workout routines, stays away from people that might try to stress her out and distract her, meditates at least twice a day, sleeps well and continues to eat well, she will be champ for a few more years without a doubt.

The best surprise meat was when I tried something odd or unique.  I tin foiled wrapped a 5 lb piece of marlin at buried it in spicy Korean kimchi and two big sticks of butter, closed foil and on grill med low heat for 25 mins

Also this whole podcast was one of the best ever!!!!",neutral

There are very few people that could have played Joker following Heath Ledger's performance, and I was actually excited when I heard it would be Joaquin.

The movie was a commercial rip off of Scorsese's films Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but nowhere near as powerful or original. About the most daring thing it did was use a Gary Glitter song. It was worth a watch but not a classic. The character is also too lacking in intelligence to inspire an uprising. He certainly mismatches the higher intelligence of Ledger's Joker. And the ""hype"" around this movie smacked of PR marketing. 6/ 10",neutral

The primary plot of ""Joker"" is he was cut off from his medication because the government eliminated the program and he went insane. I think many people missed that message in this movie. That being said, Bruce giving money for public interests groups would not really be a good comic book. It's kind of like trying to create the Series Breaking Bad in a Country with free healthcare.

On Mikhailas meat debate.

Jordan - One of the people on the other side who was rallying against meat, delivered the most preposterously, unsatirisable, politically correct rant that I'd ever seen anyone deliver anywhere by a factor of about five.

Joe - cracks up.

She just about made me convulse. And part of it was sympathy ya know because it was so over the top and so utterly miraculous and two of her compatriots were sitting in the audience and one of them said ""every hamburger is served with a side order of misogyny""

Joe dies.

Jordan - ""Which is a really good line ya know because you know they crafted that line, it's a pretty good joke but she associated the oppression of women with farm animals which is (laughing) a dangerous territory to wander into that analogy, and she compared the husbandry of animals to slavery which is a place you wander into real carefully when you choose your metaphors. And she said the reason were bombarded with image of sexy chickens and sexy pigs is to feminise our farm animals before devouring them.

Joe - Are we bombarded with images of sexy chickens? Miss Piggy, are we bombarded, cause she's our only one! Is this woman on a miss piggy rampage? What fuckin sexy chickens are there?

Jordan - Hey man, you tell me?

Joe - That sounds crazy.

Jordan - Oh, you wait man because I'm praying they'll release it because it will go viral.

Joe laughing.

Jordan - This is like Cathy Newman on steroids

Joe - crying.

Jordan - I mean it man it was something, I was sweating.

Joe - Irretrievable. ""She sounds like Titania McGrath.""

But it is remarkable how well it works for me to combat anxiety when its at unmanageable levels. Thats less and less currently because of change of lifestyle. But I had an absolutely horrible experience with SSRI meds, paxil/paroxetine in particular. These are generally regarded as the safe and low risk long term anxiety or depression med, as compared to something like a benzo which is highly addictive for many. SSRI's won't give you any sort of high or head change immediately, it takes a few weeks to gradually even slowly start to ""work"". for me it just made me an emotionless robot with no sexdrive or drive for life or relationships in general. at first you don't realize that, you just are thrilled to not be dealing with debilitating anxiety. but the real hell is getting off of them for me, and most everyone i know. You certainly cannot die like cold turkey benzo stoppage but the neurological effects are ridiculous. brain zaps, insomnia, unmanageable rebound anxiety that was 100x worse than anything id experienced prior to being prescribed them etc. 

My advice to anyone dealing with anxiety/depression and possibly considering medication is seek natural alternatives first. I am not going to say that there is no need ever for anyone to go on meds or proclaim to be an expert but just from my experience and learning of the experience of so many others like me through the journey, most likely your problems are stemming from a possible variety of other issues. meds are grossly overprescribed and most doctors don't even consider anything natural to discuss with you. for most of us it is largely nutrition and exercise that can be causing a good percentage of the issue. eating healthier is one thing, but finding out what macro and micronutrients you are deficient in (we all are mostly) is huge. working out in some form or fashion is huge. it can be whatever suits you, if you aren't as much into weightlifting, try a sport, try jogging, try yoga and find what you like. meditation and daily time away from social media or electronics can be big. reading and writing for me works wonders. make sure you get on a good sleep schedule and are getting quality sleep. in the short term this is all much harder than taking a pill but long term you will thank yourself.",neutral

Eventually I had surgery on my jaw that fixed the issue and I slowly tapered off it over 6 months.  It isn’t hard at all if you do it slowly.  So many weak and dramatic people in this world. The best medicine for me was getting my two dogs.  If you give to society, and animals in particular, it gets you out of your own head.    Saying that a medication is “evil” is so totally stupid and says more about your lack of self control than the med.  Currently benzos are a poor choice because there are safer and more effective options but that wasn’t the case case 25 years ago when they first became widespread! I like JBP but the way he is an advocate for personal responsibility for everything except alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids etc. pisses me off.

I can totally relate to Jordan not being able to sleep. When you are going through an anxiety attack, you may wake up many times throughout the night in a puddle of sweat. Or you simply just can't sleep. Because your mind is racing. At first you totally don't understand what's going on with you. There were times I had to just go for a drive. Whether it was during the day, or the middle of the night. Because it helped ease my mind. Once you start to manage it better, it gets easier. But sometimes you're overwhelmed to the point to where you just aren't thinking clearly and you try to look for an escape. That escape could be drinking, or drugs. Or it could be what I used to do and go to various parks to hike, going to a school track to run, or simply going for a drive to try to calm down. Hats off to those who suffered the same way. I understand completely how you feel. At times you just want to live like it's your last day on earth. Because you feel so awful and miserable and like it could really be your last day on earth. Just keep moving forward, even if it's a crawl. When you look back, you'll be proud about how far you have came and what you overcame while having to suffer so much and it not defeating you. I'll take physical pain over mental pain any day. Those who know what I'm talking about would more than likely tell you the same.",neutral

Seems disingenuous in the context he's talking about them.

Don't want to diagnose him,  but he still seems to be suffering from some painful psychological issues and is in some denial about some aspects of it.  Hope he gets better soon.

Love or hate JP all you want. Listening to his teachings helped me in recovery. He’s a flawed man. Just like the rest of us. But if you can separate the “art from the artist” his lectures open up doors to redemption. It was because of listening to him I started reading great thinkers like Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Jung, Frankel, Nietzsche, etc. Those works opened my eyes to a deeper part of me that made a lot of the pain I was, and am feeling, bearable. I was a cynical atheist suffering from ptsd. I saw absolutely zero value in religious teachings at all. Now, after looking deeper, I see that I was arrogant for thinking I could put myself in a position to judge ANY teachings if I was not able to judge my own actions and take accountability for them.

Is it possible that articles that enhance one's openness and perception provide a enlightened experience, with visions and such that our unenhanced mind could not comprehend, but could only due to the circumstances?  In such, accrediting the Shaman with a real experience while discrediting Moses and the burning bush are contradictory.

1477,Jordan Peterson's Realization About the Bible,2022-02-03,"I mean, he is right technically, if the word of God was the foundation of the world like it says it was. But the idea the Bible itself, like the Torah, or what not, as writing and books evolved, was and remains the first, it'ss a possible statement, but I would need to do more research on its fact. Seeimg as in the Christian ethos, God builds the world on His word, and creation is set to give out His word, it is really the foundation of all truth that influences everything, but that's a big step in faith more than a historical record. The record doesn't exist and not everyone forever has written down their own thoughts. It just follows from the principles.

1485,Jordan Peterson's Realization About the Bible,2022-02-03,"Jordan basically just said that culture is a structure of category that we all share because society tends to perceive things in a similar way at a base level, which he says that in the case of western literature and ideology can be attributed to the Bible. Since the Bible was the first book (actually a collection of books, a library) all subsequent books and works of western literature can be derived from the relationship between the first words ever to be transcribed and copied over and over in the original bibles back in the day. He’s saying that since the Bible influenced writers like Shakespeare, who in turn influenced further and further writers into the modern day, that the Bible is a core and underlying truth within all of western culture, regardless of race, social class, or even your religion! Now I guess this makes sense if you take what he’s saying symbolically, as of course all of our current knowledge is dependent on the sum of the knowledge we have built up culturally as a society over time. However, Jordan says that he himself *literally* believes that the Bible is the underlying cultural knowledge that is the purest form of true knowledge… And it’s not hard to see that this belief is flawed as taboo themes such as slavery are not exactly condemned in the bible. It doesn’t take visiting the museum of the history of slavery for me to suddenly realize that slavery is bad!",positive

This wisdom is freely given to those in a truly real, obedient and deep relationship with the Lord if only they ask... Man I wrote a long time of thoughtful and caring paragraphs about this and the deep mystery of what JBP is getting at here with a little more clarity and insight than he's providing with love and enthusiasm that was not in anyway divisive or careless and the algorithm or my bad connection I assume ""deleted"" it ... ? I got to screenshot it but I didn't do my usual copy and paste routine ""just in case"" since most anything true and useful has little place here. That makes me curious as just to why?? Sadly, I'll have to rewrite that ""thesis"". Lol.

Anyway, JBP is getting it here in what he's on about. It's crazy when it really happens and you see the truth of this reality of all our existence and the Creator who started it and why things are like they are reassures you that you're in the right place and on the right track.

I guess when the reality of life today is deep and possibly biting, truth that frees all mankind is meant to remain inaccessible and unacceptable to all us ""plebs"", much like Joe Rogan himself recently for instance. With the evil powers that be in their half hearted attempt to ""deplat"" one of the last few remaining honest, fact checking, real and honorable ""truth seekers"" left in multiple mainstream platforms.  They try hard. Way too hard and even the rubes are seeing how ridiculous it all is now.

No matter the differences we have with a lot of people the true colors of those in the last few years (especially the last two years) and how much they abide by and live by the words of our countries founders and ideals and now near non-existent Constitution.

Epistemology - ""the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion. Only reason combined with scientific discovery, leads to the pursuit of truth. The Bible sets the preconditions for the manifestation of faith. Faith is not truth. Only the devout confuse the two.

It is because Chinese 1,300 years ago used many less characters, no punctuation marks until very late. There are no genders, time is NOT instilled in a grammatical order - this archaic seems to me more of of bunch of ideas that a modern intermediate student can logically deconstruct, and understand the meaning of texts written in Bible times.

When I was playing high school and college sports, the ""trainers"" were often more damaging than helpful, and instead of rehabbing injuries actually made them worse. You have to develop your own training routines by listening to your own body, for whatever sport you're playing: football, basketball, tennis, rugby, surfing, all required different muscle development and post event care. Cross training is also super valuable, sand volleyball made my basketball jump powerful, cycling and weight training gave me endurance and explosive serves and ground strokes in tennis.

Everyone needs to be aware of what’s happening to, and rally around; Nicholas J. Fuentes.  A young man of good moral character - doesn’t drink, smoke, fornicate or fight.  A young man whom has never been arrested or even charged with anything in his entire life.  A young man whom was the president of his student council in high school and whom often wears suits.  

However, the stark contrast to that is he’s also a young man whom... is on the no fly list!  Has just been subpoenaed by Congress!  Has his money seized!  Has done nothing wrong, is not charged of any crime yet has no recourse!  This is absolutely unprecedented.  The most fitting example of civil rights abuse, as he doesn’t even have any institutional support. He is literally experiencing and fighting this on his own. 

A total legend, but where is the outrage?  Where is the ACLU?  Where is the American public?  The latter I think doesn’t know and HAS to be informed.  This is unacceptable and if we don’t fix it now it will be unrecoverable.  This affects EVERYONE https://youtu.be/GAkjr0rVVQI",positive

However, the long hours are necessary to become a good cook. It takes time, experience, and exposure. The more hours you spend in the kitchen, the quicker you will gain experience. Just to get the basic skills down, you are talking 4-5 years of working 50-60 hours a week minimum.

Being called to cover a shift is a common occurrence. You always have a lot to do and usually understaffed. More often than not you're being underpaid. And the killer is food service/cooking jobs are everywhere so the whole, ""We're doing something special"" speak isn't really true. Everyone has to eat. Unless you seriously enjoy cooking I strongly recommend to not pursue cooking as a career. Ive met some really cool people in my time and sure you build a strong rapport with your kitchen staff. But honesty that's because if you didn't the job would become even more hellish. If you really want to make money I'd recommend pursuing fine-dining, catering, corporate cooking or cooking for some sort of institution. That's where your money is.

I found out he was the coke dealer for the district's executives and their chefs... I quit, and 36 other people quit because the guy started buying premade sauces and the lowest quality of everything possible.  Six months later I saw one of my co-workers at a gas station.

2297,Top Chef's Philip Frankland Lee on Receiving a Michelin Star,2022-01-30,"the sad reality of the food industry is that the workers are horribly underpaid and woefully overworked. i used to routinely run 10-16 hour shifts. And I don't care if you are made of machine parts, after 12 hours of work you are making mistakes you normally wouldn't and fumbling around when you could have handled much more but you are just tired. And i was a 20s young guy who worked out and ate healthy in contrast to 95% of my co workers who drank heavily and ate junk food afterwork. 
After years and decades of working like that I seriously doubt you are a better cook than you were when you started. and do you know what 2 legal drugs chefs consume the most during work? cigarettes and coffee. both of which completely destroy your taste buds making you unable to taste anything (a primary job for chefs is to taste the food before serving).
So honestly the business end of the food industry is destroying chefs lives and making them worse at their jobs. and this has been going on for decades. despite the hard work these people have put in, most of it were wasted.",negative

*1.* _Take risks in your life. If you win, you can lead; if you lose, you can guide._

*2.* _People are not what they say but what they do; so judge them not from their words but from their actions._

*3.* _When someone hurts you, don't feel bad because it's a law of nature that the tree that bears the sweetest fruits gets maximum number of stones._

*4.* _Take whatever you can from your life because when life starts taking from you, it takes even your last breath._

*5.* _In this world, people will always throw stones on the path of your success. It depends on what you make from them - a wall or a bridge._

*6.* _Challenges make life interesting; overcoming them make life meaningful._

*7.* _There is no joy in victory without running the risk of defeat._

*8.* _A path without obstacles leads nowhere._

*9.* _Past is a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay._

*10.* _You can't have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time._

*11.* _If what you did yesterday still looks big to you, then you haven't done much today._

*12.* _If you don't build your dreams, someone else will hire you to build theirs._

*13.* _If you don't climb the mountain; you can't view the plain._

*14.* _Don't leave it idle - use your brain._

*15.* _You are not paid for having brain, you are only rewarded for using it intelligently._

*16.* _It is not what you don't have that limits you; it is what you have but don't know how to use._

*17.* _What you fail to learn might teach you a lesson._

*18.* _The difference between a corrupt person and an honest person is: The corrupt person has a price while the honest person has a value._

*19.* _If you succeed in cheating someone, don't think that the person is a fool...... Realize that the person trusted you much more than you deserved._

2677,Unanswered Questions About Epstein and Ghislaine,2022-01-15,"Ghislaine's father was Robert Maxwell. A Czechoslovakian Jew who escaped the Nazi's and became a British citizens fighting against the Nazi's  in WW2.
He ran a few shady businesses and eventually became a media tychoon, (his great rival was Rupert Murdoch.)

At one point he was declared, not a fit and proper person to run a company,by the British government. They knew back then, he was corrupt.

His phone book contained lots of world leaders and powerful people. He would often speak to the Soviet leaders of the day.

One of his companies developed an early computer software that countries would buy and use but what they didn't know was, there information was being accessed by Maxwell's company and the Israeli's who helped develop the software.

Maxwell was part of honey traps operated by Israel, used to gain information.

He was buried will full state honours in Israel after a mysterious death following a falling out with Israel about a large debt. 

Gislaine is thought to have continued her fathers work, via Epstein and others. The classic honey trap has gone on for decades, once you have a politician or powerful person photographed with an underage girl or boy, you have absolute power over them.

McMaster on the USA's Economic Competition with China,2022-01-14,"Ok credit where credit is due: The General is a great interview and the views on China are refreshing and timely - it’s time they were called out on their duplicity. The interview was a little light though on calling out where there are real issues with the US military, however, like with Cost Plus;  if we want an efficient military it’s time the weapons manufacturing and finance sector stopped bleeding the system with bloated profiteering.  It would have been nice to acknowledge that Afghanistan was as much about quarterly profits as peace.

Competition is a strength of the United States economic system, China just used the United States' strength against itself.

Also, China know just how to play the game better. They can control their corporations to do exactly what they want and can use authoritarian ways to combat present and future pandemics, which is more effective than the Democratic way of dealing with it. Hence, their economy will do well through the good and bad times. 
Plus, their focus seem to be on having the greatest economy and will do everything to achieve it. The US on the other hand, cannot because our politicians are bought and paid for by corporate lobbyist. Therefore, it is about corporate interest rather than the interest of the country. 
Also, as far as interest of the country goes, China also has policies where its citizens are taken care of better than it is in the US, which all boils down to corporate interest preventing us from getting there.

The only way the US can prevent China from being the world number 1 is to start a war and to win that war. I don't see that happening cause the US citizens would reject any attempt at war. It's too dangerous.
 Other means of preventing China from being number 1 would be soundly rejected by corporate America. Corporations run this country.",positive

If US politicians had any sensibilties, they'd be working with large US corporations and giving them tax breaks in exchange for setting up manufacturing - all things related to the supply chain - right here in the Americas, with a focal point being the USA if the US is the country of origin. Instead, Dems have stymied energy independence, as has Canada, and both buy oil from overseas entities. And instead, they vilify successful American companies and seek to penalize them for success thru heavier corporate taxation, which will continue to drive manufacturing elsewhere.

Lol! Well, at least McMaster is being honest about it. :D

At the end of the day, nothing China is doing is any worse than what US has done. 

Control of trade route that accounts for 30% of world trade? Erm... Yeah... 90% of the trade that goes through SCS is to and from China. :D

Coerce other countries? Australia was pretty cool with China, even agreed to allow China to construct its 5G network until Pompeo dropped in for a visit.

The whole ""debt trap"" narrative is only valid if you condescending assume that the countries along the Belt Road initiative to be backward or corrupted and are incapable of thinking for themselves and take out loans that they can pay off.

The border dispute between India and China. A childish spat that is nothing worse than US and North Korea fighting over a tree at the DMZ.

Honestly, what US is doing is nothing new. The same narrative was cooked up for Japan back in the 80s. It was used as a production base for cheap labour and once it grew rich enough to threatened US, anti-Japanaese sentiment was stirred, Japan was forced to sign the ""Plaza Accord"" which brought about their Lost Decade.

But I do disagree with some of the things he said. In particular creating these ""centers of authoritative information"" that folks can trust to provide factual information. This is an ABSOLUTELY terrible idea. Its clear that if an organization like this is corrupted or taken over by a political party or even another country that that information could do considerable harm. Think carefully about how trusted the news media USED to be. And people took a lot of information they presented in the last few years as fact until it was clear that they are full of shit.  The best way for organizations to be reliable is to establish a track record of information that readers/viewers can self verify and therefore establish a relationship of trust.",positive

Out of that came a smaller thing that shot out flame and fought off the Egyptian army all night until the sea parted. Leviticus 10:1 where something comes out of the pillar of cloud in the sky and sets down in front of the Tabernacle, then shoots out fire and kills Aaron's sons when they walked up to it. The pillar of cloud/fire that led the Hebrews to Israel; which when it stopped, was the sign for the Hebrews to camp. Out of it would come a ball that would drop down into the Tabernacle, and into the Holy of Holies to sit on the Mercy Seat of the Ark, and tell laws to Moses. Not to mention this occurred at the same time that Amenhotep III was pharaoh, his first born son Crown Prince Thutmose mysteriously disappeared from the historical records (the Passover...?), leaving next in line Akhenaten to reign, he becoming the first monotheist, ironically deciding to worship ONLY the ""sun disc"" god Aten, possibly because he either saw the thing in the sky that helped the Hebrews escape, or heard talk about it by his father and other witnesses after the fact.

Back in 2010 at about 3am just outside of Banff, Alberta, Canada. Craziest thing about it was the amount of coyote howls that started just before we seen it. If it wasn't for the howls we might have missed it because they were howling from everywhere, not like when they kill and call for a feed. I probably had a visual for about 20-30 seconds but that was enough to change the way i see the world and the possibilities of the future. So I know aliens exist 100%.

The benevolent ones keep their distance, encouraging us to mature philosophically and spiritually so that we don’t destroy ourselves with technology. That’s one of the main reasons they don’t give us their tech, it wouldn’t teach us responsibility, and one of the first things we’d try to do with it is convert it into a weapon. If we were suddenly given intersystem travel tech, we’d also become a potential threat to other planets. We have historically been inclined to conquer and colonize.

The influence of the negative ETs is limited due to the benevolent ones and our collective planetary consciousness keeping them at bay. The negative ones primarily try to create governmental power structures of mental, financial, military, social enslavement by influencing the elite of the elite of our people. “Loosh” is a thing. Also, if they can get us to wipe ourselves out, there’s components of a planet that has began the evolutionary process that are valuable to extract compared to non-evolving planets. Additionally, if we were to successfully continue evolving and join the benevolent ones, we’d be another thorn in the negative ones side.

Then imagine how far along they would be in comparison. All you have to do is think of our own future and how crazy it might one day be and realize, others are probably far past even that. They would have had to solve many of the petty issues we still face today, long ago. Just think of what we could achieve even now, if we were better organized. If we actually had harmony. We're probably not too far away from sending ""artificial"" intelligence off into space to explore and look for answers on our behalf right now. And that's taken us a miniscule amount of time compared to the age of the universe, while at the same time we're still going to war over things like ancient religions..

Even stepping in when they see things going in the wrong direction.. Wouldn't we do the same if we found a planet with a primate life on it? Sure, maybe ""god"" gave Moses the commandments. Maybe he appeared in burning bushes, maybe he did tell Noah to build an ark. Maybe Jesus did perform miracles, rise from the dead and ascend into heaven.. Oooor maybe it was something else?.

If it weren't for that, they would still be the dominant form of life on this planet, and we would still be small mammals hiding in the bush. Also, rather than highly intelligent dinosaurs texting their friends, they would just be the same super predators more or less unaltered. You can see this with ancient creatures that are very successful and avoided extinction events, such as sharks.

A few years after the first shot in New Mexico, a craft arrived and crashed outside of  Roswell which is a short drive from White Sands, NM where that first shot of an atomic bomb was tested. Coincidence? Phase 2- Above ground nuclear testing in the late 50's and early 60's. More craft spotted around the globe. Phase 3- Underground nuclear testing. Larger craft were being reported and abductions began. Now it was the scientist's turn to take a close look at us and other flora and fauna. Leave no trace behind, just like good campers,  and everyone examined came back. Phase 4-Since then they have been keeping a close eye on nuclear naval task forces, missile bases, They come down to military bases where nuclear weapons are stored.

Earlier on IG for example, the app showed things in chronological posting order especially when coupled with specific hash tags.

It doesn’t make companies do anything, no infringing on their rights (assuming companies have rights which legally they do ) it simply prevents them from unfairly targeting others for any reason. It prevents them from doing things as as opposed to laws saying you have to do x. Instead you cannot do y (actions that negatively harm others) This was the original talk till the right (who are almost just as bad) realized they could run on big tech problems.

3457,Should Social Media Algorithms Be Regulated,2022-01-14,"Josh Szeps works for the ABC. The ABC is like the BBC of Australia. It's a publicly owned broadcast network (funded by the Aus Government). 

For many years it was seen as the bastion of very credible journalism in Australia, and it was, but in the last 20 years or so it's gone the way of most other mainstream media.

Part of the picture is that the Australian Liberal Party (our Republicans, kind of) who have been on power for the last 9 years have basically captured the network. Most notably they fired the previous chairman in 2018 in some contraversy and installed a Liberal party lifer as chairman.

Now the ABC is basically a soft propaganda machine for the Liberal party masquerading as a progressive news organisation. 

Having said that this guys bias is more representative of the general viewpoint of the majority of urban Australians (which is a large majority) who consider themselves progressive, cosmopolitan and are generally doing fairly well.

Australians are very compliant compared to other populations like US and France, and it's not because we don't have guns, like Joe keeps trying to argue. It's due to a mix of cultural and economic factors. 

Australians across the board have enjoyed a fairly affluent upper middle class existence for much of the last 40 years compared to comparable developed populations. Many reasons why. Low population, high resource exports, strong labour laws, etc etc

This consistent affluence has made the population extremely politically apathetic. We just want to keep our property boom and tax benefits and as long as that's there we won't kick up a fuss.

Basically we haven't experienced enough bad times to make us mobilise effectively when our rights are threatened. 

This guy's perspectives, and his almost brash faith in 'common sensibleness' are very representative of this considerable class of Australians who still have a lot of faith in classic institutions of power to have their best interests at heart.

I hope this helps some people from the outside understand what is going on in Australia. All the best",neutral

Most, if not everything about everyday life is occurring on social media thru smartphones. This use has begun to dull and numb our consciousness for it may allow us to lose the sense of humility and empathy in regards to one another. 

Also, the pandemic(with its associated constant fear porn) has increased the manifestation of Herd Psychology or as Dr.Mattias Desmet from the University of Ghent recently described, 'Mass Formation',  where we now see the sows of division increasing from the already present form of the culture war, which had been slowly manifesting for at least the past decade.

It's really somewhat ludicrous as all we'd have to do to retain some collective psychological order or to preserve our mental state and thus understand one another as individuals with individual thoughts/forms of expressions, is to not conform to Big Tech and turn off devices that might otherwise distract us from learning and expanding on, once more, the human experience.

About ""ALL"" the gold: The mining methods during the time Spain controlled the American colonies were EXTREMELLY primitive compared to what we have now. I don't remember the number but there was some comparison that went something like ""the equivalent of all the gold and silver that Spain took from the americas is mined in just 2 years nowadays"". Its probably more or less time but it was something like that, just to give context to how slow and basic surface mining was at the time, without any of the advanced machinery of nowadays. 
Also it is true that the gold and silver was spent and left spain almost as soon as it got in, but inflation also plays a part, as Spain was bringing so much new silver to Europe that the value went down.

 Spanish coinage was so universal that they were found almost annywhere in the globe and were the de-facto global currency, to the point that USA used Spanish coinage for many decades after independence, and pegged the dollar value to the ""Spanish dollar"" for many years.",neutral

Most of that gold was spent on wars in central Europe (which was part of its empire) to fight protestantism. Another great part of its gold was spent battaling separatist revolutions in America and Asia, as well as fighting against the US in Cuba and the Philippines. The Royal Navy did little harm to the Spanish Armada, most of its ships were sunk by bad weather. It was more probably the other way round, a single Spanish commander, Blas de Lezo, single handled (he only had one arm, and also missed a leg and an eye) defeated a whole British fleet at Cartagena de Indias. The biggest threat to Spain from Britain was the British Freemasonry, which conspired with separatists to spark revolutions in the Spanish colonies (i.e. Simón Bolívar was their useful idiot). The little gold that remained was lost in the Spanish 1936 Civil War when the Communist Revolutionist Government stole all the national reserves before retreating from the capital, Madrid. The commies gave all the gold to their sponsor, the Soviet Union, but they surely pocketed some of it themselves because they lived some pretty fancy lives in the exile.",negative

3670,"Empires, Conquerors, and Martin Luther",2022-01-11,"Since everyone is chiming in about Istanbul/Constantinople, I figured I'd throw my uneducated thoughts in the ring. The main reason Constantine moved the capital to Constantinople was to have a more defensible capital. As Europe became an increasingly militarized and wartorn region, the city of Rome became something of a sitting duck. It was simply too easy to invade, and as we know, every road lead to it. In fact that's why later we'd see cities like Venice emerge, basically built in a swamp, because it was harder for armies to invade it. People initially moved to Venice for safety.

Of course, Constantine could've just relocated in Ravenna, Italy. That was another easily defensed city that would act as the capital of the Western Roman Empire in the empire's later years. But Constantine wanted to get away from the corruption of Rome - being emperor in Rome was to be the constant target of murder plots from powerful families. Constantine wanted to have a capital city that an emperor could truly hold under his thumb.

Also, in the later years, the Roman Empire had all sorts of different capitals set up to deal with how hard it was to govern regions of the empire from afar. It was something of a necessity. Constantine figured it was time to be rid of makeshift second capitals, and to create another capital worthy of the Roman Empire.",neutral

This meant British ships could sail circles and fire at the Spanish from beyond Spanish-canon range. Of note, many think the story ends there. It doesn’t. While British cannons had a longer range — the shot fired was light and couldn’t penetrate the Spanish ships which were heavier than the British — meaning that while the Spanish couldn’t catch up to the British, most of the fire the Spanish received from British cannons bounced off so some argue the effect of longer range cannons was to frustrate and demoralize. Similar to the effect of our revolutionary, longer-ranged rifles utilized against the British during the American revolution.

The fall of the Eastern Roman Empire, Constantinople, nearly 1000 years after Rome, is the most important, overlooked event in all western history. And they never used the term ""Byzantine"" but were properly Roman and referred to themselves as Roman. Constantinople was the gateway and Christian stronghold to the west. It's fall can be attributed to both the Renaissance and the Reformation, as it infused Greek scholars, philosophy, and most importantly, the Greek Scriptures to the Catholic West. 

Additionally, the severe trade deficit fueled Colonialism which sought resources to replace much of what was lost that Constantinople provided in securing trade between East in West. Constantinople fell in 1453. Columbus sailed in 1492. The fall of the great city ended the Middle Ages.",positive

3745,"Empires, Conquerors, and Martin Luther",2022-01-13,"This is perhaps somewhat beside a point, but it is interesting how history keeps repeating itself. Throughout time, virtually all empires have fallen. And thus it is very probable something like that will occur again and the empire to fall is probably USA since USA has been influencing and dictating trends for a long, long time now. 

People, even the sceptics, would probably want to believe that because we have so much technology, medicine, culture and knowledge, we should be able to prevent a downfall of any potential empire or country, but if you look at things from a certain let's say conservative or strictly pragmatic or technical perspective, things went off the rails probably a long time ago in the western world, or in the world in general. 

Over the years, I think all of us here had a conversation about how things are too hedonistic, too shallow, too liberal, etc., how we consume too much, how we live in excess. Isn't that interesting? That pretty much everyone with half a brain sees our way of life and understands this is probably unsustainable and yet we all then just wake up another day and keep doing the same stuff and we get dragged into the same ego trippy ambitions, etc. 

It''s also fascinating this awareness of how the world is wrong is so prevalent, that movies, TV shows, etc., our modern way of entertainment keep ruminating about it in movies like Don't look up, or even commercial movies like Avengers: Infinity war, where Thanos' plan to erase half the universe is obviously rooted in the general awareness of our overpopulation. 

It's like the ultimate downfall of this particular way of life we're used to is so inevitable, it's literally pop culture now, which is absurd if you think about it. That so many of us see it, so many of us know about it, but none of us at this point can or will do anything about it, because a) most people don't care, b) even the very smart ones that should lead the way have become decadent and vain to a degree, like Elon Musk, or Bill Gates, c) we're all far too lazy and comfortable at this point.

Famine is coming but not for the reason either Adam or Joe are thinking.

This all works because the US is engaged with the world but we are pulling away. For example when the Iranians seize that South Korean oil tanker what did we do? Both Trump and Biden shrug their shoulders and did nothing. The system that the US built for the past 75 years is coming up part not by design but by neglect.

4284,"Adam Curry on Why ""Food Intelligence"" Will Become Important",2022-01-17,"Regarding grains, I dont think Joes opinion is accurate although it does reflect our modern biases.  Grains are ubiquitous so it is natural that a few people will have allergies to them such as gluten hypersensitivity.  However in the big picture they are actually plants with the LEAST endogenous toxins...unlike legumes/beans/lentils, leafy greens, and large animal meat products.  This is probably due to the fact that they grow in large fields and have had little need to evolve such defense mechanisms and also because they have been selectively cultivated by humans for thousands of years.  Large animals store various toxins they ingest throughout their lives.  Many more scarcely growing plants have various poisons they have evolved to protect them.  Grains do deserve some demonization from the way they are processed into high glycemic index foods and via pesticide exposure, however i think organic unprocessed  grains are actually one of the least poisonous and most  nutritious food products most people without allergies can eat.

It was about food security and rationing. They were focused on keeping people alive (short-term), not necessarily healthy (long-term). They needed to shift money from food production to weapons manufacture. That's how the government got into the business of prescribing American's dietary needs. It was during WW1 and the Great Depression. That's when the fillers were introduced systematically like cellulose and vegetable oils. It was guns and butter policy. They wanted the public to buy it so they cooked the data and sold it as a superior product. Anyone who criticized the health ill-health effects was suppressed because healthy food is harder to produce and scale in wartime. By the time the U.S. economy recovered, that's when the profit motive kept it alive. By that time, it was in everything, and admitting anything would have been a major cost and harm to international brands. Nazi Germany was selling orange soda branded as Fanta when it was made from recycled orange waste product! Also now that Federal gov was in the business of prescribing dietary needs, the U.S. meat and dairy lobbies had an incentive to influence the allotment of their product on the Food Pyramid, which is why we see various versions of this over time as they bartered for a percentage of the plate.

Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First, some questions are being asked by Insider like ""Are you living on the planet you think you are?"" which made people react differently than before.
The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought-provoking, to say the least.

What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short period and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in-depth and some epic answers showed up minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from the internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on the internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects.

Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all leads to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.
Sounds hard to believe? Read on

4807,Oliver Stone on the JFK Assassination Cover-up,2022-01-08,"I find it funny how anyone who has any experience with firearms through battlefield experience or hunting that really understands the impacts of rounds on people or animals. They are automatically considered conspiracy theorist because they understand that this clearly had to be the work of more than one person. The real conspiracy theories start when everyone tries to figure out who. Follow the money who lost money because of his decisions. There were alot more players in this whole thing than is even presented in Oliver Stones movie. I think Oliver Stones movie is quite a low estimate short of all the players involved. Who lost money Big oil lost money on the oil contracts they had in anticipation that the Bay of Pigs is successful. The CIA lost assets there that were unable to fight because the arms were not there for the fight. The fact that JFK swore to fracture the CIA into a thousand pieces. The Secret Society's he had talked about being a stain on our country. The Industrialized Military complex because he was trying to pull out of Vietnam. People say well its hard cover up stuff, it's not. People have heard the truth and still have a hard time believing it about a multitude of topics.

He had more to gain from the assassination than anyone and was probably not only going to be dropped from the ticket in1964 but was also facing serious charges for his misdeeds, including murder.

4817,Oliver Stone on the JFK Assassination Cover-up,2022-01-22,"So something I would like to know more about is if anyone knows or can explain the backstory of Bush Sr. and JFK's relationship?

My son's school had a writer and ""truth seeker"" come (which I wish I would've known about prior, so I could've attended as well) and do a presentation on JFK's assassination. 

My son, who at the time was 16, only told me about it after I picked him up the day the presentation was given. He also, unfortunately, only told me very little of the speech. 

I immediately thought, of course, it would be what they wanted the students to hear... How it was Lee Harvey Oswald and no others. 

I must admit when my son told me the man believed through all of his years of research led him to believe it was a hit job and the man to do it was Bush Sr. Needless to say I was taken aback, only because this presentation and info being told to the students was given during high school, which you automatically assume they believe in conformity and not bring a man into the school to deny the original story of JFK's assassination.

4839,Oliver Stone on the JFK Assassination Cover-up,2022-01-07,"Stone is great, and we all owe him a debt of gratitude for forcing the creation of the ARRB with his movie JFK. But the defense of LBJ in the matter of the assassination is the height of credulousness and probably stems from legal threats by Johnson’s estate. Lots of researchers reject the notion of Johnson’s complicity because their archival research doesn’t uncover a paper trail, and because (as Stone says) LBJ said in later years he thought the CIA was behind it. That is extreme credulity, just as it is credulous to entertain the notion that LBJ seriously feared war with the Soviet Union or Cuba. It is nonsense. LBJ controlled both the military and the Secret Service immediately upon JFK’s death. He was directly involved in the cover-up, not out of fear of war, but of fear that he would be exposed as having had advance knowledge of the crime, and therefore complicity. The cabal that organized the assassination made sure LBJ knew it was going to happen, because they knew that that way he wouldn’t step out of line once he was in office. It worked. All of the records of LBJ’s sessions with his psychiatrist in his post-presidency years remain totally sealed under a strange “attorney-client” arrangement, and that is why researchers can’t go there. LBJ was a crook, a scoundrel and murderer. Nobody should be pulling punches where LBJ is concerned just because he was a “Democrat.”",neutral

4846,Oliver Stone on the JFK Assassination Cover-up,2022-01-13,"Real idea for future episode: I’m so glad Joe brought up Tom O’Neill’s discovery from CHAOS that Jolly West was in Ruby’s jail cell. Joe needs to bring Gerald Posner on, who compiled a convincing book investigation about Lee Harvey Oswald demonstrating that he was the assassin and did it alone. There are compelling explanations for Oswald’s and Ruby’s behavior, the magic bullet and how Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner in Stone’s 1991 movie) manipulated sources and evidence to make his case. Posner has also written books about MLK’s assassination, the Vatican Bank and Pharma among others. Amazing investigative journalist.

To thicken the plot even more, if Joe triangulated between Oliver Stone, Gerald Posner (who has debated Roger Stone’s book claiming LBJ is behind JFK’s death) and Tom O’Neill he could dig into Vince Bugliosi’s massive magnum opus book defending the Warren Report. Remember, Bugliosi (now dead) was Manson’s prosecutor who used the Helter Skelter motive.

Joe has the resources to bring all this together and I know that I and a lot of other people would love to see these minds brought under the same roof. It would lead to entirely new connections and avenues of inquiry.

Including to Russ Baker and his evidence that the CIA staged Watergate to get rid of Nixon, who was paranoid that he was boxed in by the intelligence agencies. Baker also reveals additional aspects of the JFK assassination including how the soda bottlers (whose foreign bottling plants the CIA used for operations) loathed Kennedy because Castro had nationalized Cuban sugar plantations.

The lack of sugar made them turn toward Monsanto for saccharine which put Monsanto on the map. Nixon was a lawyer for Pepsi when Kennedy was heading for Dallas and the Dallas bottlers bought the largest venue, ensuring Kennedy’s lunch would be at the trade mart and his route through Dealy Plaza. They organized a charity rodeo for orphans event requiring national guard vehicles to be stationed on the other side of Dallas delivering the children.

Allen Dulles was also on the board of directors for Scholastic, which made textbooks for school children. Russ Baker also introduces George Bush Sr’s involvement in all this along with the intelligence/military/energy connections that eventually formed the foundation for the Saudi royals and Bin Ladens investing in Bush family businesses related to oil and airlines. What Oliver Stone said about Northwoods being the grandfather for 9/11 gives me chills.",positive

4895,Oliver Stone on the JFK Assassination Cover-up,2022-01-06,In the 90s I dated a girl who’s grandfather was one of the doctors in the room when Kennedy was brought in after the assassination. Apparently there was more than a few people in and out of the surgery theatre as well as the room where his body was examined afterwards. They couldn’t get any sort of order or normal protocol and from what he always said there was way to many people interfering and making sure things weren’t done by the books. Almost nobody would give their names or ranks/departments except the military people that were there. From what he said many times when recounting the day they were just given instructions on what to do and how to do it and weren’t allowed to properly go about a post-mortem like they would usually do. It was apparently very clear from the start that they weren’t allowed to do things by the book like any other murder victim and it was almost impossible to get anything done the way it should be done when dealing with a shooting victim. He was obviously really affected by the whole situation and held a lot of regrets/guilt for not being able to carry out the proper autopsy. It was really sad actually I think he blamed himself a lot for not being able to do what was right and he carried it with him for the rest of his life. But there was no doubt how much of a massive coverup was going on even at that early part of the whole fiasco. Shady as fuck. And obviously meticulously planned from start to finish.,negative

Also it wasn’t the entire military that was in charge, it was George Burkley; JFK’s doctor who was ordering the autopsists what to do and what not to do. Which by his own admission in an affidavit to the House Select Committee on Assassinations is true, “I directed the autopsy surgeons to do a complete autopsy and take the time necessary for completion. I supervised the autopsy and directed the fixation and retention of the brain for future study of the course of the bullet or bullets.”-HSCA File 013416, Record 180-10104-10271, page 3.

It was said that the brain analyzed in the autopsy was intact and that it weighed even more than an average undamaged brain. I don't doubt that this is true - and if it is, it's one of the shadier features of this case - but it makes me wonder: If this was truly a cover-up, why in the world would they use a completely intact and larger than normal brain to present in a public autopsy? Was there nobody around with the wherewithal to suggest removing part of the brain used in the autopsy? This is not to say that I think the official story is true or that the fact mentioned in this clip is false - I'm perfectly willing to accept that what was said about the autopsy brain in this clip is more than likely true, which directly contradicts what I saw in the Zapruder film - I'm just shocked at the proposition that the ones who conducted the autopsy would allow something so suspicious to fall through the cracks, presumably while they were trying to maintain a cover-up.

Just thinking about who could get 3 people to shoot at once, and not just anybody, but the president. On top of that in the middle of a parade and get away with it.

4934,Oliver Stone on the JFK Assassination Cover-up,2022-01-05,"Actually, the term ""conspiracy theorist"" refers to this actual situation originally, there were the people that believed the findings of the Warren Commission, who put forward the ""lone gunman theory"", where Oswald was the only shooter, and he did this alone, and then there were the people who didn't think Oswald could have done it  alone, who believed that he CONSPIRED with another shooter, and this was the ""conspiracy theory"". Then, that term was used regularly while associating it with being unhinged or crazy, as a way to smear anyone who didn't believe the mainstream, official explanation. For years, conspiracy theorist meant simply that you believed JFK was the victim of a conspiracy to assassinate him, but after it was used more and more as a derogative, or a smear, it was used more and more to discredit anyone who is skeptical of official narratives in regards to government malfeasance, specifically things like false flag events.

4939,Oliver Stone on the JFK Assassination Cover-up,2022-01-05,"At 65, I still remember that day:  I was 7yo, an Air Force brat, living in England; my dad was a fighter pilot.  Living on base, every individual unit came w/ a speaker box- to hear bulletins, alerts, etc. from a centralized source.  And I still remember that radio squawk:  that the president had been assassinated, that the base was in high alert/scramble mode, and to shelter in place.  I was in 3rd. grade.

When I was in college I had a physiology class; a special guest of the professor was another forensic pathologist- who had medically investigated the event- and concluded that it was impossible for one gunman to have inflicted all the wounds noted.  This was 1975.  It was about a three hr. presentation, and I walked away thinking the obvious:

He only pandered to the conspiracymongers and only listened to pro-conspiracy stories while making his film.  Any movie is going to take liberties with the truth but turning villains into heroes and heroes into villains?

I also saw Jeff Dunham perform at Hoagy's. It was before Achmed was part of his act.

I feel the same way I did when I was a kid and would join in on bullying I knew it wasn't right but it just came natural everyone else was doing it and when I hit the point where I stood on my own and would defend it the kid that was being bullied I never went back that feeling was better than acceptance. Now I have realized adults are no different LOL carrot top sounds like a good guy and from here on out I see him in a different light.

I fled Houston, got on medical cannabis, and 10 years after I landed in Seattle, I am drug free. Save the Cannabis products.

5421,Big Pharma's Role in the Opioid Crisis,2022-01-02,"As someone who lived through all of this, I remember the day, I think it was in November 2011, when the gov changed the law to where if you got a pain pill prescription, you had to go to the doctor every month (instead of every 3 months). This made pain pills price go up around 400%. So, you can either spend 70$ for 10 Vicodin that last you a day, or 40$ on heroin that will last you 2 days. And in a few years you’ll need 20 Vicodin a day, and maybe 80$ worth of tar/fent. So the higher doses required, the most cost effective hard opiates are. 
The dramatic rise in pain pill prices, after the market was fucking flooded to insane heights, created the opioid crisis that is still on going. That is my assertion at least. If pain pills were cheaper, then people wouldn’t move to cheaper and STRONGER alternatives like heroin and Fent. Then they just die because these street drugs are impure, and doses aren’t consistent, so as you climb the ladder of needing more and more, the likelihood of you getting an inconsistent batch and dying is dramatically more likely. I lived in a small town in Texas when all this was going on and I have had 4 friends OD on god tier opiates. I’ve saved 1 friend by throwing a suboxone in his mouth as he OD’ed in my car, since suboxone has Naloxone which is the same shit as Narcan.",neutral

I’ve had it since I was 10 and have had 7 major small bowl reconstruction surgery through out the years. When I was a kid in the 90’s I remember some pain medicine but wasn’t on it long after surgery or during flair ups and trips to the hospital. 

I had my 5th surgery in 2008 and was prescribed loratabs, I had maybe 20-30 pills and were 5.0 strength, yet again I took them for after surgery and they worked well for the pain and then after a week or so went to Tylenol and was fine, I moved on living my life, I had a few left and thru them in my pill box under the bed. 

Then in 2010 I started having crohns issues again and had several trips to the dr’s office, ER for pain and stays in the hospital for pain management. I remember diladid was the new stuff that the hospitals were prescribing out via IV injection instead of morphine and said it was 2X stronger and less dosage and lasted longer. After I would be released I was givin scripts for loratab, or percocets for pain, 5, 7.5 and 10 they worked well and helped with pain, the only thing was they stopped working after a while and I would need to take more and more to get the same pain relief and the high from them. I was constantly in and out of the hospital and the drs couldn’t figure out what was going on, wasn’t sure if it was my crohns or something else, I had a good surgeon show up and suspected a bad gaul bladder but couldn’t do a liver panel because of the drugs I was on.

In 2004, at a different hospital, I had minor surgery on one of my hands--so minor, that I was able to go home 2 hours after waking up in the recovery room.

To my shock and disappointment though, a HUGE percentage of people just BLINDLY trust in doctors (who by the way, many are educated by the pharmaceutical companies directly) and they get injected or drink medicine regularly without questioning or doing some research and they put their bodies at a higher risk of health problems down the line. I understand there are some medicines that can save lives but this depends highly on risk-benefit analysis and this is why medicine should NEVER, EVER be mandated and always an individual choice because medicine always comes with risks.

And since I had a congenital condition at birth (that now doesn't bother me), I used that as an excuse to get more pain pills. Eventually i was prescribed Percocet, Oxycontin, and Roxicet 30mg. I would get a ridiculous amount of pain pills per month. Then I would show up early and try to fill my script, which drew red flags that my doctors noticed. They only stopped giving me a prescription when they were getting warning letters from the DEA, which caused them to not prescribe opiods. This eventually led me (and millions of others) to do Heroin.  That cycle of addiction lasted 10 years. Fortunately, I am 5 years clean.
My point is- my doctors were caring and wanted to help me. But instead of prescribing a holistic regimen, they succumbed to their Svengali, Big Pharma.

And now the thought of questioning these vaccines,  of thinking of alternatives even,  is met with condemnation,  discrimination,  and outright anger by many people.

My chest hurt so much and I started to feel nauseous with the pain.I was trying to act normal at the dog show because I was embarrassed of my stupid ailments so this was a super difficult weekend because I had no one to give me advice. These heart symptoms didn’t feel normal and were not disappearing like an anxiety attack would. It was just getting so scary so I stopped taking them. They were supposed to help with pain but they’re not an immediate fix so they were not doing anything except obviously murdering me. I had nothing for pain except aspirin so that’s what I took.

5942,Tony Woods Spotted a Mer-Man While on Vacation,2021-12-30,"Think about how easy it would be for a mermaids to avoid all human contact if it wanted to. Every time we're in the ocean it's either near the beach or we bring huge boats with us. Stay away from those and they'd never get spotted unless they wanted to. If they were intelligent they could easily do this. 

The ocean is soooo big, it's funny that people think they know what's down there. We usually only travel above the surface and whenever we do exploratory diving it's always near a boat and easily avoided by the fish. There's just so much beneath that we'll never see",positive
