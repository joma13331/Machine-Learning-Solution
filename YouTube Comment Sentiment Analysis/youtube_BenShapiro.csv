70,Whoopi Goldberg Reportedly LIVID About Her Suspension,2022-02-04,"I DONT accept whoopis apology since it was insincere.   How am I absolutely certain it was insincere?  The fact that she is mad now shows she was not contrite.   If she was truly sorry she would not be mad at just being suspended.  And, also, in the apology where she was not doubling down on racism she was obviously reading and wasnt trying to hide that she was reading.

113,Whoopi Goldberg Reportedly LIVID About Her Suspension,2022-02-04,"I was thinking about this the other day and came to essentially the same conclusion.  

I despise cancel culture, and in almost all cases I'd be arguing for Whoopi here.  

However, what is the golden rule that can be understood point blankly by almost every human on earth?  ""Treat others the way you want to be treated.""  Deducing from this statement one can come to the axiom that ""People treat others the way they want to be treated."", assuming the person follows said obvious and universal rule. 

Whoopi is a prime member of cancel culture and has consistently called for people's heads when they've 'said the wrong thing' etc like this.  Following the above, it's clear that she would want herself cancelled, and it's only fair we honor her request.  

This is an exercise in logic, which means the left will be allergic to it, but I don't think there's much argument to be had against it.  I think if Ben brought this particular line of reasoning up on their shows, it'd result in some funny reactions (insults, change of topic, deflecting, etc) just because it's so easy to follow and hard to argue against no matter political affiliation.

It is hard to swollow that 2 weeks vacation time is her punishment. It is like punishing a child by taking their bike away and sending them to their grandmother's without imposed restriction. Other people have been fired for less. This was not a slip of toung or a bad writer. This is how Whoopie see me the world. Had she said crime is not a issue in a large city as it is mostly black on black she would not only be fired but fought in court over paying a dime for her remaining 4yr contract.

This could be relevant (broncos person who loves the city of Denver selling the team to someone who loves the city of Denver) or irrelevant (happening to connect in an interview over favorite kind of alcohol). It's not always intentional. You're looking to hire the best guy and you happen to have 3 kids and it comes up in conversation that Bob also has 3 kids. Maybe you consciously decide him being a family man makes him more qualified (which isn't necessarily true - he could be a terrible parent and just happened to get 3 different women pregnant or maybe his family values are simply different and don't really translate) or maybe it's not even a conscious part of the decision. Either way, we gravitate toward those we believe are like up. So since in the past blacks weren't allowed into the higher up positions that make the hiring choices then now pretty much all the people hiring are white and will gravitate toward other white guys. Studies have been done where the hiring guy is just given names like Bob and Devon and Carlos, and Bob gets more initial interest, even with no other factors being different. Again, that's not necessarily conscious, so I'm not sure everyone would categorize it as racist (though I'm sure some would), but in the end it's not a straight up meritocracy. The rooney rule at least means you gotta give the black guy a chance before you settle on the guy you perceive to be like you and better (btw, I keep saying  ""perceive"" because of course in reality someone with a different skin color could be much more like you in many more relevant but less obvious ways).",positive

I don't think it's racism but one thing I don't understand is that when Brian floors first started at coach of the Miami dolphins the first couple of seasons they trade off their best players to get first round picks... So now ask it an owner or a general manager you know you're not going to win a lot of games because you just traded your best talent... My mother died and then when you use those first round very few rookies have a impact year.. Brian forest and the man be dolphins probably one of the best end of the season records everyone like seven or eight games in a row... Shows you would think that the head coach of Brian forests that they'll keep him around a little bit more do the fact they gave all the talent away..... I'm a 49er fan and I remember how bad the 49ers were until they got Jim harbaugh back in 2011 and he took that team to three straight MC championships in the super bowl appearance and never had a losing record and he turned Alex Smith career around and yet he was still fired from the 49ers...

No. More often than not the coach hired knows somebody who knows somebody, or played with the coach, coordinator, etc. One of the most confusing points being brought up by people in the sports world is a lack of black ownership. I don't see how that would ever change because unless a team is for sell then team is likely to stay in the family of the person that owns it. It would be silly to create an affirmative action program for head coaching. Being a coach in the NFL is not a right. You have no right to an interview either. I do believe that there are certainly candidates with a resume befitting someone who should maybe be considered for a head coaching job who might happen to be black.

Gotta consider the other side’s arguments.
Yes, affirmative action and making decisions for the sake of diversity alone isn’t good.
However, the NFL has had openly racist policies in the past, white coaches who aren’t as qualified are getting positions over Flores (and Bienemy) who is better in multiple areas, and there is currently 1 black coach out of 32. A lot of the owners who are responsible for this are very old and were around that culture of the NFL not allowing black players this and that. If you piece this  Flores situation together with some of comments Jon Gruden made, an average person would have enough reason to believe that there may be racism present in the league. So if there isn’t anything present like the Rooney rule, or black coaches suing when they don’t think they are given a fair shot vs white counterparts, what’s the solution?

Flores should have at least been given a fair shake by the Giants, but seeing all the Bills connections, it's not surprising that Daboll was chosen. As a team, Giants should have had some diligence in finding the best candidate, which I still think is Daboll, but should have at least done a properly motivated interview

What should be bigger news is the paying to lose games, since betting is so big in the sportsbook world im sure that won't be a good thing

While 1/32 coaches being black is a little interesting in a 70% black league, I don't think it necessarily means the league is inherently racist either

The killing and expulsion of the Palestinian people out of their own land led to whatever came thereafter of decades of violence and hatred, but the original trigger was indeed the Israeli holocaust against them. The Palestinians shouldn't pay the price for the European and in particular German persecution of the Jews. In fact, they are fully innocent of it. As a decent and educated man, and I do believe you are both, you should be able to actually recognize that Israels actions, back then and presently, are in fact racist up to the level of calling Israel an apartheid state and that Jews being victims of their own Holocaust, should be a lot more sensible to what they are doing to innocent Palestinians.",negative

When Abe Fortas, an LBJ selection, resigned (over corruption charges, go figure), Nixon had two relatively moderate picks blocked by Democrats before eventually caving and selecting Harry Blackmun, who went on to write the atrocious Roe opinion.

Republicans favor constructionist constitutional justices, while Democrats favor the ones who will vote their way, even if they're corrupt, even if they write godawful legal opinions (which may explain why Roberts got more Dem support than other justices).

If there is one thing that’s abundantly clear over the last 2 years is that people in power will lie for profit no matter the human cost which is almost always visited on the poorest people these weak assholes claim to virtuously want to protect or to us working class normies. I realize we are in a time where people would rather stay ignorant as long as their feelings are catered to. These are not people who want freedom or to think for themselves they are automatons who love to worship their misdirected feelings no matter the cost. Please stand firm. I don’t know why a couple of old hippies who kicked against control in their day change so drastically when they become obsolete nor do I understand why Joni Mitchell or Neil young think themselves important enough to request anything anyway then I remind myself they are artists and it’s not uncommon for artists to have a false sense of self importance as we will all be fine without them and these two are 1 booster away from death and a library of old insignificant music won’t help that.  I also see the same issue with old fighters like Howard Stern or Noam Chomsky, for whatever reason when them greasy fingers of death inch closer it seems to strip a person of their brains and reduce, at one time amazingly brave fighters to little more than Karens. Thank you for your bravery and please don’t buckle. There is few places left to seek truth and these fools calling for censorship are to willfully ignorant to understand the consequences of the elimination of the discussion and debate of ideas.

She does not want to make this about skin color because it conflicts with Intersectionality and the CRT idea that all whites (by skin color) are ""oppressors"" and to have a group of white people to be oppressed themselves would blow this theory apart fundamentally.  It flys right in the face of their beloved CRT and she knows that and therefore did 'not want to go down that ""ally"".  If whites can only be oppressors, as CRT teaches, then Jews either cant be white or they cant have been oppressed. BUT we know that both of those things are VERY TRUE.  They most certainly were oppressed and they are lumped into the white skin category.   how can one group of white people be oppressors; if only whites can be oppressors and not oppressed.   (Even though we know Hitler viewed them as a separate race) CRT & Intersectionality dont want to admit this because it blows a hole in their theory.    BEN - I predict that we will see CRT proponents make a distinction about Jews, claiming they are not really ""white"".  Since we know CRT hinges primarily on Skin color and not race and that CRT proponents, although they refer to ""race"" they really mean ""skin color"", CRT proponents will begin to try and defend CRT by saying that while Jews may have white skin they are ""not really white"", they just have 'white skin'.  This way they can protect the idea that only white people are oppressors.  Nazi's = white / Jews = not white.  Thus, CRT ideology still works. (of course we know this is hogwash).",negative

1245,Shapiro Reacts to Whoopi Goldberg's INSANE Holocaust Remarks,2022-02-03,"I see what Whoopi is trying to say, but her views are steeped in racism. Racism to me, is simply taking anyone of different ethnic and cultural background, and declaring them of a different race (which I think Ben did a fair job of articulating around the 4 minute mark). Race is indeed a social construct, and should not be confused with colorism. Which is so frequently is... to the point that all things considered ""racist"" is actually colorist. I think the idea of people of different color, of different ethnicity, or of any such difference in between as being of a different RACE is racist. It certainly does not help that this idea is in fact perpetuated from childhood in schools up through adulthood on every application where it asks you to circle what ""race"" you identify as. 

The idea of race, in my very strong and honest opinion, needs to be removed from education. If we are to teach it, teach it with this idea in mind, that people were once thought to be of different races and treated accordingly, as social structures and changed (such as with every person from a different continent of origin and with peoples of different religious ideologies), but DNA and certainly our ability to create offspring with people of different color and ethnicity seems to suggest we are all of the human race/species. Then, go on to teach the role of ethnic background, and why these differences (which should be acknowledged, respected, and most importantly accepted) came about. Mankind could far better evolve if we would quit creating ideas of separation, where none exists. 

In the terms of the Holocaust and what Whoopi is saying, that is where she fails, in my opinion. Indeed, the Jews were treated as a different race (the social construct; racism), and it was not colorism... again, she is confusing these two things. Racism exists where we perceive others as being a different race, and colorism is very much alive and well, and aids the idea of racism when those of a different color are perceived as being of a different race. Poison to the heart and mind. 

I think had she just stuck with the very basis of what this was as genocide (the massacre of a large number of people from a different ethnicity/culture [not exact definition, meaning remains]), she would have gotten a bit less tangled.",positive

Because I didn’t say excuse me when walking out of the elevator when they were purposely blocking the way. And guess who defended me? A white man. Oh the irony!

There are many Ethiopians, Latino,  Middle Eastern/Asian and even Black and White Americans who are Jewish. They have chosen to separate themseleves from being ""White"", going along with exactly what Hitler thought and wanted. The question should be...Why? So, a person from Poland or Hungary isn't ""White"" if he or she is Jewish? A person from Ethiopia who may have even migrated to Israel isn't African because he or she is Jewish? If you ask an Ethiopian where he/she is from or what their ethnicity is...what do you think they'll say? They've all said(in MY experience)...I'm Ethiopian. If you dig deeper, getting to know them, they'll say, I'm Jewish as one would say I'm Christian.

Adele is from England and Jerry's family is from Poland/Germany so yes...they simply have different features. Are they not ""White""? People from Somali and Ghana look different.

I can argue all day long that, ultimately, it's not about race. 1) They didn't just target Jews. 2) They were the scapegoats, just like farmers under Stalin, just like other tribes in Africa in Rwanda, the unvaccinated... Targeting a group of people CAN be for many reasons, but that reason isn't the important part because it's always BS and it's always justified by ""For your safety, and those people are bad"". Obviously Nazis were white supremacists that was the whole point. But what she's saying isn't wrong, it's the human impulse to blame another GROUP that's identifiable in ANY WAY that you can use to make them into a scapegoat. You can't defend Gina for saying modern tactics against unvaccinated are just like those with the Jews in Germany, and then turn around at the same time and attack Whoopi in saying that ultimately it's not about their race, it's about THAT group of people being targeted in a nasty way, and the tactics and even messaging are not unique to race.

Oddly enough, every single race owned slaves at that time, and they owned slaves of every race they could get their hands on. In fact, most of the black slaves in the colonies were purchased from BLACK SLAVE OWNERS in Africa; but there were also Irish, Italian, and Chinese slaves in the colonies at the time.

Well, to her, I'd say she's obviously wrong. Because if she were correct, more might have escaped or successfully hid. But alas, it was obvious enough for the Nazi's to wipe out 2/3 of the entire worldwide Jewish population. It was obvious enough for people to very clearly tell who was Jewish.

By God’s grace, or just a miracle… I switched parties and became a Republican a couple of weeks ago. I’m learning more about the conservative values I grew up with. When I told my parents, they were super emotional. I think my mom cried.

He is so nice and such a positive person. He doesn't want anyone to quit listening to Neil Young, or CANCEL him and then goes on to explain himself more. He shouldn't have to do this. He is a comedian who interviews people that we'd probably never hear otherwise. And YES,he informs us
 He asks questions that the working man would even ask (me,  not even close to middle) and he is entertaining while doing it. I love Joe Rogan and the way that they are coming after him is sickening. I think he's a hilarious comedian, a great interviewer  and most importantly a good human being. I can't figure out if they are serious about all this stuff that comes out every other day where they are trying to cancel him OR if at this point they are just TROLLING HIM. I GUARANTEE stupid Neil Young's views went up more than they have in DECADES because of this. Leave Joe alone, no one wants to hear this bs anymore, it's getting old.

Joe’s probably not budging on what he’s owed and Spotify probably can’t hold him to a clause to not produce content for the remainder of his would-be contract so Joe would be paid out AND go make money somewhere else for the duration of what should’ve been his run on Spotify.

1) He has he made the SAME demands (remove his music from Spotify) years ago simply based on the fact that he doesn't want his music on a low quality streaming service (which I can sympathize with 100%).  Apparently, he doesn't have enough personal control over his music to get this done without some less than honest outrage (artistic creation control and intelectual property is a whole other discussion).
2) For literal decades Neil has been an icon among those with uncompromising principles that I ""thought"" included free speech, but here we are....it's true that you should never really get to know your heroes because they will inevitably let you down.  Neil is a human with flaws and ideals I can't know, but calling for ANYONE to be silenced is a line that anyone with any love of personal freedoms should NEVER cross.",neutral

But actually if they let him go I think it’s a better thing most of all to his listeners and viewers as he can be as free speech as he truly wants then.

1933,The REAL Reason Joe Rogan Is Being Targeted,2022-02-02,"What a superb response from Joe Rogan.

I dont like labels but the strange thing is, I consider myself Liberal and ""left"". Or I did. I stand for liberalism, social values in the community and everyone helping each other out. 

There was a time Liberals and Conservatives shared common values but that time is gone. We disagreed but had healthy, respectful debate.

I find myself in agreement with the ""right "" more these last few years. Some of my political views differ vastly from Ben's but I found we have many things in common, as of late. 

Lack of free speech, no debate, no journalism and rife propaganda is something I really expected of a far right  government but the ""left"" have taken it all the way. PC for instance. ""Fascism dressed as manners"". 

The real, Liberal left are hidden and what exists now has somehow  morphed into a mutant hybrid in which  people are willing to sacrifice their freedoms and rights for the allusion of safety and to be PC - context and intent are not even considered. Some of the ""right"" are equally as culpable, I might add. Trump was disastrous. Just as bad as Biden, if not worse. Both sides are to blame. 

We need to realise that this not about left and right. There are human values currently being trashed that should be cherished and protected whatever your political stance. This is not a partisan issue, for me. 

 Ben Shapiro could help by stopping this ""left"" labelling nonsense. They aren't left. I'm left. They are facists and opportunists, nothing more. We need to unite and hold politicians, big business, and big pharma accountable for their actions. Enough is enough. They are our employees; we are not theirs.

Besides, Joe Rogan isn’t tied to Spotify. He also wasn’t tied to YouTube. I bet you Joe Rogan made a shit ton of money for Spotify. I bet you he made a shit ton of money for YouTube. I’m sure Rumble will be happy to have him and his 11 Million viewers.

Also soldiers are trained to do a job, whatever that might be, and during a firefight they had concerns with those relationships playing a role in what decisions might be made in the heat of the moment when lives are at stake. Naturally if you care for someone romantically, you might do something to save that person instead of making a different.

2026,The Quest To Deplatform Joe Rogan | Ep. 1423,2022-02-01,"33:28 It is important to know that when MOST politicians like Kirby cite their military careers (""I served 30 years in the military""), they were serving as an Officer in some coddled/bureaucratic duty station. They weren't enlisted (in most cases) serving front lines pulling the heavy load. 10, 20, or ""30 years"" is not equal across different military careers when we compare/contrast servicemen and women. 

We all get this image in our head that ""military service"" equals blood, sweat, tears, jumping in foxholes and performing incredible physical feats in the face of danger. Yeah, those are the enlisted people (for the most part) doing that. I say this with my own military career history (USMC). In most non-combatant units, officers tow the narrative and deliver direction from the top, then senior enlisted take the ball, and get the job done. 

This is all to say, Kirby, having served in the military, does not mean he speaks for the enlisted in the military (aka the vast majority). Kirby praises wokeness because his perspective comes from a 30 year military bureaucratic perspective. In other words, he was basically a military politician while in the military AFTER graduating from OCS. 

So what is the context of Kirby's military history? Public Affairs. He was also an Editor In-Chief of a Navy magazine. Then became a spokesman for the Navy. Since his military career ended, he was a spokesman for the State Department. John Kirby has ZERO idea of what the frontline soldiers, sailors, and airmen know/want/need. He is a mouthpiece for liberal agenda within the military.",neutral

If you do not do what we say, we will punish you through economic pressure or incarceration, or we will compel you to do what we say under threat of violence.""

The recipients of federal funding...States, individuals, hospitals, etc..all agree to meeting the statutory requirements so any change also needs to be implemented through legislation not arbitrary exectuive agency fiat!

Once again it is a question of the Constotutional separation of powers and the right of voters to hold Congress accountable. The people's power to hold their representatives accountable is unconstitutionally denied when the unelected agency bureaucrats are illegally delegated the power that belongs to the elected legislative branch! 

Also we need to get back to limiting federal legislation to issues delegated under Section 1 Article 8 and stop the insane expansion of what the Commerce Clause actually authorizes...which is strictly trade among the states and not the authority to deal with any issue that involves all states. 

In fact there is no constituutional  justification for OSHA or the Department of Labor.or the Department of Energy or even the CDC or FDA....those are state powers nowhere delegated to the federal government.

In this case, I disagree with Ben Shapiro. Appointing someone to the supreme court simply because of their skin color, is at it's core, racist, as Shapiro says. However, this is exactly what white government leaders (especially men) have been doing for America's entire history. This favorability has stifled women in government as well. Shapiro is failing to understand that the status quo cannot change without taking action. The only way to give women and minorities fair representation in government is to get behind them and support them. When we reach some version of equal representation, then it would be agreed that what Biden is doing is racist, but we are not there yet. Now, in 2022, are all white people racist? No. In fact, the majority are not. But we are too comfortable with things such as the fact that we haven't had a single women president. We should be insulted by this, and we should be talking about it, because it's not random chance that has resulted in every president besides Obama being a white man. Many effects of past governmental practices that WERE racist have not disappeared, and many older leaders still in power, come from a time where racism was widespread. So, just ignore all the extremists who say white people are racist, but try and consider the core idea behind what Biden has done here. The idea that old white men are racist originally referred to a specific generation of white men (who are still around, but quite old). Lastly, I just want to point out, that it seems like Shapiro purposefully didn't mention that Trump vowed to elect a women to the supreme court in 2020. I wonder what he'd say about that?",neutral

3647,The Border Crisis Grows While Biden Eats Ice Cream,2022-01-27,"Mr Shapiro, please allow me to share this comment which I originally left for Mr Gutfeld and the Five.  It is on-topic with this video.

""Could it be that criminals are sympathetic with other criminals, Gregg?

If they can get society to treat criminals with generosity, then they will have set-up a more acceptable consequence for their own to pay, when their criminality is revealed - and they know the reveal is in the works?

Create the problem and design the reaction. Mass Narcissism of the global elite.

Why the bail ""reform""? 

If we are distracted by chaos on our streets, how likely are we to have the focus to see them strategically setting up the pieces for WWIII?

Hunters 'collections' from China, Russia, and the Ukraine now take on a potentially darker connotation. Hillary's awkward oversized red reset button's symbolism takes on broadened significance.

My theory that the Reich has it's true origins in China may be more accurate than anyone had imagined.

How culturally diverse is China, Russia, or Iran/Radical Islamic states?   Aryans were not solely German, do not forget.

Now do you understand colonizing mars (in case they unleash hell on earth in their pursuit for world domination), and climate change funraising (in order to fund all things mars, and some things war) etc?

As long as they have us, 'simple-minded peasants' distracted with new colors and names of candy, or arguing about faux systemic racism, or the ramifications of transgenderism, how can we be calm-minded enough to see their strategic moves at overthrowing the West, not just the USA?

As long as our systems are overloaded with sex, violence, games and entertainment, how can we think clearly enough to identify the dangers we are being set-up to face?

The things we are experiencing, suffering, and witnessing are not stupidity, nor due to happless incompetence.  

Everything is happening from wicked, intelligent orchestration.

They are becoming increasingly enboldened by the lack of citizen resistence, thanks to the control through fear that the 'organic origins' of COVID have served them.

Don''t forget the warnings re: 
Divock Origi - COVID Origins spelled backward, and the coincidental pro soccer player cousin of Obama from Kenya...remember his wife, Dr Linda Adhiambo Oucho, the African Migration Policy Dir...the migrant crisis the West has been seige to, and the mass incursions at the US southern border, are all by design, not lofty ideals.

Don't forget that Hunter Biden has quietly married a South African.

Their insults (""Son of a b*tch) are borne from their profound disdain for unworthy, non-elite.  

Prior to disparraging reporters, Biden, with Dr Jill by his side, told a battalion of servicemebers in Hawaii, ""Clap you stupid bastards.""

Now he is mobilizing 8500 servicemembers to the Ukranian - Russian warfront.

The scent is so communist that we missed how Reich-like the origins are.

The majority who are helping them achieve these goals are unaware of the end-goal they are playing a role in realizing.

The few can not achieve this without the participation of the many.

It's urgent that the many regain control.",positive

3746,The Border Crisis Grows While Biden Eats Ice Cream,2022-01-27,"Illegal immigration has changed through the years. Now 2022, people aren’t crossing borders for a “better life”, the increase in fentanyl trafficking, human trafficking, extortion at the boarder with people crossing illegally , it all proves it. We can see the cages and the detention centers holding people that have no clue what goes on in the states. As a Hispanic, I used to believe everyone has a chance to better their lives but that’s changed to everyone has a chance within the guidelines(laws/policies) to better their lives. Enforcing the border isn’t about kicking people out and setting up cages. Enforcing it means building proper facilities to process all these immigrants.

The latter refused. This led to an extremely violent coup in early 2014 (the so-called ""Maidan"") in which countless people died and at the end of which the president had to flee. Following this coup, a ""transitional government"" was installed by openly right-wing extremist parties, ukrainian nationalists who abolished ""Patriotic Victory Day"" (The victory of the Soviet Union over the Nazis) as a holiday and instead made it the birthday of Nazi collaborator and mass murderer Stepan Bandera. It is EXACTLY THESE fascists that the people of eastern Ukraine have a problem with, and it is EXACTLY THESE fascists that have been waging war against their own people in eastern Ukraine since 2014.

You may not be sure of where you belong anymore. But home is always there. Because home is not a place. It's wherever your passion takes you. As you continue on your path, you will lose some friends and gain new ones. The process is painful, but often necessary. They will change and you will change because life is change. From time to time they must find their own way, and that way may not be yours. Enjoy them for what they are, and remember them for what they were.

If Russia or America goes to war with each other and one of the two thinks that they will be annihilated by conventional arms, they have nothing to loose and will go with the nuclear option. It’s never a good idea to underestimate your enemy. But the Biden administration seems incompetent, foolish, weak and corrupt. All a combination to lead us to a possible WW3",negative

Hello, American's. I'm Yaroslav, and I'm from Ukraine, but now I live in Moscow. I found this quite an interesting channel on the space of YouTube. Some channels translate Ben Shapiro's videos into Russian. I respect different positions, but I disagree with some things, that were mentioned by Ben Shapiro, for instance, the Civil War in Russian empire (1917-1922). There isn't everything so easy, as it can be. Even if you are against communist (partly, Bolsheviks), you don't understand the whole situation, that was there, and why they were needed.  Also some details are incorrect as facts, like supporting Kerensky, because he left Russian in 1917, when everything has begun.

      Today can we honestly say that we would use a newspaper article as a reference when writing a paper for school. This is a major betrayal of Truth of History.  And if all these news organizations are just confirming what each other is saying be it not true then as a society we have failed. We can no longer establish a point of reference for documentation. 
     I remember taking a class in health sciences and was told to be very careful and to vet my sources carefully when you learn critical thinking in college you have to ask yourself is this a reliable source.

5650,James O’Keefe Reveals the Secrets of Undercover Journalism,2022-01-24,I am a strong believer of science and data. South Korea achieved over 80% vaccination rate of population within very short period (less than 6months) but infection as well as hospitalization rates increased substantially. Also Singapore and many APAC countries. But why all politicians still blame unvaccinated people? This entire approach is so wrong. Current measures are simply not working based on data. The risk of Korea is strong lockdowns they have done so far which prevented young healthy ppl to get exposed to virus and immunized because as pharma companies admitted vaccination doesn’t necessarily prevent the increase of infection rate. Who all saying Korea has still very low absolute amount of infection cases do not fortify your argument. You must see the growth rate of infection and hospitalization cases post high vaccination rate. Obviously seasonality plays some role here because normally ppl get sick easily during winter. But just imagine the entire world tested and tracked the infection and death rate of seasonal flu we must have locked for decades. Of course covid is dangerous but it is getting mild and we can’t and shouldn’t live like this forever. Is there any government or orgs provided definition of end of covid? Is zero covid what you are pursuing? Look at China! It is simply not possible.,negative
